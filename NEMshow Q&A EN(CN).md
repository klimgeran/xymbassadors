**NEMshow Q&A EN(CN).md**

**为什么您总是强调nem？ 在我的观点，Symbol与XYM的命名不好，但现在已开始，我们应该尽力而为。**

* Why do you always keep stressing nem? In my opinion, Both naming of Symbol and XYM are not good, but now it has started, we should go ahead with it.
---------------
**技术在不断发展，我们需要加快速度推出品牌，否则会后悔。**

* Technology continues to evolve and we need to get our brand out there much faster, otherwise we'll regret the timing.
--------
**我们希望营销品牌容易被大众接受。**

* I expect your marketing and branding to be easily accepted (and understood) by the masses.
---------
**不要做任何额外的事情**

* Don't do anything you shouldn't.

**观察在日本的情况，尤其早期的 NEM 在“品牌化”方面取得了成功，因此没有人特别注重品牌化。由于每个人都有独特的设计理念，想像NEM的使用方案和未来，并且祈求投资成功，试图以自己的方式传达和传播NEM。我认为这是创建去中心化经济区需要学习的东西。然而不幸的是，我们觉得 Symbol 的命名过程有一半被强行推出。在当时 NEM 基金会代表的 Twitter 民意调查中，许多人想要“包含 NEM（专有名词）的名称”或“Catapult”的名称，但提出都不是这两者的名称和标志时，我们惊呆了:推出的是 Symbol。因为启动经常被推迟，这暗示如果我们不同意这个想法，能更进一步推迟，我们把提前启动放在首位，也认为应该这样做，我们最好选择在 PoI 投票中选择“是”。尽管我们投票赞成，仍然推迟了一年多。这样的背景是造成当前品牌混乱的过去事实。这不仅仅是你喜欢或不喜欢 Symbol 这个命名，或它是否合适。以上是我的想法。我终于习惯了 Symbol 这个名字，但我仍然对这个标志不满意: NEM 标志是自由而且积极的，但 Symbol 标志却有某种压抑感。除了热情洋溢的NEMber，尤其在日本以外，似乎Symbol被理解为一种NEM的衍生币或其他东西，目前仍没有被广泛地理解为 NEM 的升级版和 NEM 生态系统中的主链。 当然，造成这种情况的原因之一是人们不习惯变化，但很明显，这是最初品牌的失败。如果你仍然坚持品牌化，Symbol 现在已取代 NIS1 为 NEM 生态的主链，NIS1成为互补的子链。如果能传达出强烈的信息，广为人知，我认为没有必要更改名称。但是，如果社区的意愿得出结论，最好重命名一个或两个并重新开始，我认为这很好。无论是哪种结论，从现在开始都有一个负担。太空海盗指南强调“破坏”，但如果你不害怕破坏，你可能还需要决心摧毁你的半生不熟的品牌。不，恐怕我们还没有取得任何成就以至于害怕破坏。毕竟，对于那些成功地使用技术的公司或开发商来说，不会只选择他们的品牌。我认为投资者也是如此。我认为技术将成为我们自己和其他人的解决方案。品牌闪耀是信任和成就的证明。最后，我们不负责选择这种前所未有的双链系统。这是核心开发人员和一些人在闭门讨论后做出的决定。由于法定问题，我不得不使用两条链。不要让我们在这方面迷失太久。耐心是有限度的。**

* Talking about spotting in Japanese situation, branding success especially in the early stage of NEM was, there was no specific person who emphasized its promotion. Due to that each one empathized with the design concept in their own sense, each one dreamt about use cases and its future, and believed in the success of its investing, and has tried to communicate and spread the word about NEM in our own way. I think this is something that we need to learn about creating a decentralised economic venue. But, unfortunately we feel the naming process of Symbol was half-imposed. In a Twitter poll conducted by representatives of the NEM Foundation at that moment, lots of people wanted a name that included NEM (a proper noun) or "Catapult", but we were stunned when neither of these names and logos were proposed: it was Symbol. The situation was, the launch had been postponed so often, and it was implicated that if we didn't agree with the idea, it could be further postponed, and we decided that the best thing to do was to vote "yes" in the PoI poll, because an early launch was our priority and should it to be done we thought . Nevertheless we decided it would be best to vote "yes", but it was still delayed for over a year. This is a fact that these backgrounds that we had have caused the current branding confusion; it is not just a question of like or not like the naming of "Symbol", or being suitable or unsuitable for. This is what I think. Personally, I'm getting used to saying Symbol finally, but I still don't feel comfortable with the logo: the NEM logo was free and positive, but the Symbol logo has a certain oppressive feeling that I get uncomfortably. Except for enthusiastic NEMbers, especially outside of Japan, Symbol seems to be recognized as little more than a derivative of NEM or some extra, and there is still no widespread understanding that Symbol is an upgraded NEM and the main chain within the NEM ecosystem. I'm sure, part of the reason for this is that people are not used to such changes, although it is clear that this is a failure of initial branding. Even though you still insist on branding, make clear this point that Symbol has replaced NIS1 as the main chain of the NEM ecosystem, and NIS1 will be a complementary sub-chain of Symbol. If only the point will be widely known with a strong message to the public, I think that no need to change names is necessary. However, if the community chooses that the best thing to do is renaming one or both of them and starting again, then I'm fine with that. Either conclusion will be a burden to be borne in the future though. The Reflections of Space Pirates emphases 'destruction', and if you're not afraid of destruction, you may need to determine the courage to ruin your half-baked branding. Nevertheless we haven't achieved anything yet to fear its ruins. In other words, those who will succeed in using technology as companies or developers will not choose them only its brand alone. I think it's the same for investors. The point is, how technology can be a solution for them or someone else. A brand is a bright testimony of trust and performance. In conclusion, there ain't any responsibilities with the community for the decision to use the two-chain system, which has few precedents. The decision was taken after closed discussions between the core developers and some other people. Due to legal issues too, the 2 chain solution had to be chosen, even though we have understood that. But please don't keep us confused anymore. Patience will not last forever.

**虽然还很新，但我认为“Symbol”这个名字是阻碍大家认识它的因素之一。它应该是一个独一无二的名字。另外，我希望您停止为 NEM 投入大量资源。**

* After all this time now but Symbol, it should have given an one and only name. I think that the ordinary naun "Symbol" is one of the factors that hindered its recognition. Also, I would like to ask you to stop resourcing too much to NEM please.
----------
**老实说，从开发者的角度来看，无论是Symbol还是NEM都无所谓。不过，我接触了Symbol和NEM技术，觉得很棒，所以支持。如果你能以完整易懂的方式向非技术人员解释它就可以了。例如，当您想到比特币时，每个人都会想到虚拟货币比特币，对吗？我觉得就是这么简单。说到 Symbol，就像 XYM。 NEM 是否成为 Symbol 的子链，对大众来说并不重要。
另外，请丰富开发文档。技术再好，没人用也没有意义。当前文档缺乏用例，示例代码被省略太多，难以阅读。好像不是经常更新。如果你真的想增加开发者的数量，或者你想进行实际的社交实现，请让文档足够详细，让初学者理解。**

* To be honest, from a developer's point of view, it doesn't matter whether it's called Symbol or NEM. Why do I support Symbol and NEM because I have been exposed to their technology and think it's great. If you can explain it to a non-technical person in a complete and clear way, that's fine. For example, when you hear Bitcoin, everyone thinks of the virtual currency Bitcoin, right? I think it's as simple as that. Like Bitcoin, if you heard Symbol, everyone imagines its native currency XYM. It doesn't matter if NEM becomes a sub-chain of Symbol or not, it's none of the public's business. And also, please enhance the development documentation more. No matter how good the technology is, it's useless if no one uses it. The current documentation is lacking in use cases and the example code is too abbreviated all the more, hard to read. It doesn't look like it's being updated often. If you really want to increase the number of developers and promote real-world social implementation, please make the documentation so detailed that even beginners can understand it.

-----------
**NEM 似乎有早期投资人称之为核心团队和信托的人，但请说明他们有多少，他们有多少收入，他们有什么样的决策权，我们不要求提供个人信息。如果要强调透明度，我认为这是第一步。这是因为他们的意图似乎在之前 NEM 社区的基金决策以及 NEM 基金会和 NGL 的建立/运营中发挥了强大的作用。现在他们几乎都失败了，他们是否有辨别事物的能力是非常值得怀疑的。如果他们继续拥有强大的决策权，我认为 NEM/Symbol 作为一个去中心化的地方将继续薄弱，所以我认为我们也应该审查治理体系。我认为在多次被证明失败后，通过关于品牌建设的肤浅辩论可以解决这个问题。**

* I heard that NEM has a core team of early investors and others, called the Trust. Please clarify how many people there are, how much importance they have and what decisions they have. We do not ask for personal information. If you want to emphasise transparency, that's the first place to start I think . Because they seem to have had a strong hand in the decision making of the former NEM Community Fund and in the creation/management of the NEM Foundation and NGL. Now that they have largely failed, it is highly doubtful that they have the ability to see things differently. And if they continue to be the major decision makers, then NEM/Symbol will continue to be weaker and further away from the decentralized philosophy, and the way of governance should be reviewed. After so many failures, I don't think a superficial discussion about branding is the answer.

-----------
**说到NEM生态系统，应该让 NIS1/XEM 以及 Symbol/XYM 有明显的区别。遗憾的是，在目前的情况下，造成误导的条款较多。我认为通过再次推出 NEM，NIS1 / XEM 和 Symbol / XYM 都会出现一个好时机。谢谢您的考虑。**

* If you are going to describe the NEM ecosystem, you should make a clear distinction between NIS1/XEM and Symbol/XYM.Now, disappointing that there are so many misleading statements. We believe that this would be a good moment for both NIS1/XEM and Symbol/XYM. Thank you for your consideration!
--------------
**两条链 NIS1 和 Symbol 令人困惑。许多人不知道 Symbol 是 NIS1 的重大更新。我认为尽快解决这个问题很重要。**

* Two chains NIS1 and Symbol bring a lot of confusion because there are now, and many people don't know that Symbol is a major update to NIS1. I think it is important to resolve this issue quickly.
---------------
**它已经变得流行，因为 NEM = XEM，所以我认为在这里说 NIS1 只会令人困惑。而且自从之前的盗窃事件之后，NEM 的形象仍然是负面的，所以我认为 Symbol 没有必要敢把 NEM 带到前台。作为新一代优秀的公链，如果 Symbol 被管理层和工程师知道，并且真正开始发生交易，我认为它会一下子传播开来。（我希望这样！）**

* The public already knows NEM as XEM, so it would be confusing to say NIS1 now. And since NEM still has a negative image from the past theft, I think Symbol does not need to put NEM in the forefront. As the new generation of the best public blockchains, I believe that once Symbol is known to enterprises and engineers, then transactions actually start to occur, it will spread rapidly. (I hope so!).
----------------
**有没有什么大消息会影响市场价格？ Symbol 花了那么多时间才最终发布，但知名度太低且交易量低。**

* Is there any big news that could affect the market price? Symbol had been taking a huge amount of time to finally release, but is too unknown and the trading volume is low.
-------------
**我支持你**。

* I'm behind you.
------------
**如果是Symbol，请以 Symbol 形式披露整个表面的信息。确定 Symbol 新闻或 Nem Group 的 Symbol 新闻。
**

* As far as information is concerned, if it is a symbol, please push the word ”symbol”. Symbol news, or symbol news by Nemgroup, is OK.
-------------
**我期待提高对 Symbol 的认识！**

* I hope it will raise awareness of Symbol!
---------------
**未能为新产品打上品牌后，重命名过去的产品是荒谬的。交易所对旧产品更名反应不顺，就停止处理。将营销成本（对营销经理的奖励）用于 Symbol 上市的交易所上市技术支持。**

* It is ridiculous to change the name of a past product after failing to brand a new product. Exchanges will not readily accept the renaming , they will just stop handling them. Spend the marketing reserve (remuneration for the head of marketing) on technical support for the Exchange's listing of the symbol.
------------
**我期待Symbol**

* I'm looking forward to the symbol!
--------------
**我想让你成为其中之一。**

* I want them to be merged into one.
-------------
**我期望 NEM 和 Symbol 的未来。我最初对 XEM 进行了长期投资，现在仍然如此。如果 XEM 是黄金，那么 XYM 应该具有附加价值，例如白银。除了 NFT 之外，我认为我们还需要世界上的人们从未想过使用的创新技术。我们将继续支持 NEM 和 Symbol 的发展。我想同时投资 NEM 和 Symbol 的未来。**

* originally a long term investor in XEM and I still am. It would be nice, XYM being accepted as silver when XEM is gold. I also think that we need innovative technology that people around the world will want to use, not just NFT. I will continue to support the development of NEM and Symbol.
--------------
**价格太低、太混乱。**

* Too much mess for a low price
--------------
**我希望你在你的推特账户上放更多的 Symbol。环顾世界，我想大多数人都不了解 XEM 和 XYM 的关系。我认为重要的是每个人都能在瞬间理解以便传播。我认为如果名称易于每个人理解而不是困难的名称，那么 NEM 和 Symbol 的表现会有所不同。**

* I would like to see more symbol on Twitter account. I think that most people in the world don't understand the relationship between xem and xym, and to spread it, it's important to make it instantly understandable for everyone . I think it's important to make it easy for everyone to understand, and I think it would be different if the other performance parts of NEM and symbol were named in a way that everyone could understand, rather than difficult names.
-------------
**我相信你。**

* I am trust you
--------------
**我认为 NIS1 很难理解。**

* I think "nis1" is difficult to understand just because of its name.
-------------
**不断努力品牌推广，增加交易量，从而对价格产生积极影响。
**

* Please make a sustained effort to brand your business in order to increase transactions and have a positive impact on prices.
--------------
**NEM 的名字太知名，Symbol 太不知名了。应该单独标注。**

* The name of NEM is too strong and Symbol is too unknown. Should be branded separately.
-------------
**聚合交易（Symbol）的有效期（2天）太短。我希望延长期限。**

* The validity period (2 days) of the aggregate transaction (Symbol) is too short. Make it longer please.
--------------
**我希望 Symbol 是世界的一部份👍。**

* I hope that symbol will become a part of the world👍
------------
**没有人知道 Symbol，所以我认为这里的NEM1（NIS1）和NEM2（Symbol）没有任何问题。NEM在日本非常有名。
NEM1 和 NEM2 不是好的地方吗？**

* Not many people know Symbol I think. NEM is well known in Japan, so I suggest NEM1 and NEM2 is a good place to start. How about this?
--------------
**不要忘记，投资者会为事物增值。换句话说，好的技术需要好的营销。NEM 小组在地区的平衡非常糟糕。我承认技术，但我不认为我会再投资。另外，手机钱包为大家提供了一个轻松触碰 Symbol 的机会，但它会留下虚假的迹象和缺陷多久呢？您应该尝试找出并清除让您感到那种草率的部分。**

* Please remember that things only become valuable when they have investors. NEM group has a very bad balance in this area. I appreciate the technology, but I can't see myself reinvesting in it. Also, how long will the mobile wallet, which is said that giving everyone easy access to Symbol, continue to be mislabeled and glitchy? Should work to identify and eliminate such sloppiness.
-------------
**Nem 不是Symbol。Symbol不是 Nem。应该利用这两个特征来生存。**

* Nem is not Symbol; Symbol is not Nem. Both characteristics should be used to survive well.
-----------
**我支持你们。**

* I support you guys.
-----------
**我总是很感激你的帮助。我希望你继续强调Symbol是主链。对于有兴趣的用户，如果您能采取一种鼓励用户积极开展公关活动的方式，更不用说技术跟进，我们将不胜感激。我期待着与您合作。 感谢大家的帮助，请继续强调Symbol是主链，以这样的方式接近感兴趣的用户，他们不仅会跟进技术，而且会想自己积极推广。感谢您的支持，为了未来。**

* Thank you for all your help and please continue to emphasise that Symbol is the main chain and approach interested users in such a way that they will not only follow up on the technology but will also want to actively promote it themselves. Thank you for your support for the future.
-----------
**如果你把 NEM 看作是 Symbol 的门户，我认为有必要改变 NIS1 的品牌。**

* If we think of NEM as a gateway to Symbol, I think there's nothing to change the NIS1 brand.
-----------
**请专注于扩展开发和用例不要说废话。**

* Stop such nonsense and focus on development and expanding use cases
------------
**对于内部讨论和后续进展，请不要限制在 Discord 内部共享信息，也可以在 Twitter 等其他媒体上传播。Discord 是一个任何人都可以进入的封闭空间，在日本还不是很熟悉。另外，在推特上，核心开发者以外的海外人士的呼声越来越高，整个街区都开始被拉向那些声音的方向，无论是好是坏。我希望你坚定地表明你作为日本的地位和存在感。
**

* Discord, a closed space where anyone can join, and it's not very familiar in Japan. Please announce it on Twitter or other apps. Also, the voices of non-core developers are getting louder on Twitter, and the whole community tends to be pulled in the direction of those voices, for better or worse. I hope that Japan will show its position and presence.
-------------
**Symbol 应该是“Symbol inside”，就像“intel inside”。是“New Economy Movement”，意思是“新经济过渡”，而不仅仅是“未来的金融”。**

* The symbol should be "Symbol inside", like "intel inside".　Be "New Economy Movement", which means "transition to a New Economy", not just "finance of the future".
--------------
**目前 NEM 在价值上是压倒性的优势，所以我觉得如果我们能用 NEM 名称的价值来展示 Symbol 技术的高水平就好了。**

* At the moment, NEM is the dominant name in terms of value, so it would be good if we could use its name value to promote the high level of technology of Symbol.
--------------
**在推广 Symbol 作为主链时，一般形像明确为 NEM=XEM，而且由于 NEM 和 XEM 的logo形像是一样的，所以 XYM 也被封装在 NEM 的框架内，对 XYM 的识别将是一个 XEM 的红利认可，XEM的一条子链的认可会更适合全世界。我认为消除这种形像是不可能的。这是一种品牌战略。将 Symbol 升级到 NIS1 的 XEM 的品牌形象策略很重要。然而，NIS1 这个名字并没有普遍的渗透性。这不应该诚实地使用。由于NEM的名称是新经济运动，我认为将 NIS1/XEM 和 Symbol/XYM 与 NEM 分开的品牌策略也是不正确的。换句话说，需要让与 NEM 的文字形象相关联的内容以通俗易懂的方式登陆 XEM 和 XYM，并且能够强烈地联想到 NEM=Symbol。我的命名建议如下。-重命名为 XEM = NEM Classic。重新更改徽标图像。- 将名称更改为 XYM = NEM Symbol。请勿更改徽标图像。- XEM 和 XYM 周围的 NEM 徽标图像不会更改。是否接近以太坊和以太坊经典的关系？将 XEM 定义为明显旧的，不要将您的徽标图像与 NEM 链接。将 XYM 图像与 NEM 链接。尽管如此，可以确定 XEM 和 XYM 是 NEM。这个很重要。
**

* In promoting Symbol as the main chain, it is obvious that the general image of NEM = XEM has been established, and the logo of NEM and XEM are the same, so as long as XYM is in the frame of NEM, everyone's perception of XYM is that it is only a part of XEM, and the world may rather perceive it as a sub-chain of XEM.I think that dispelling this image is not an easy task. It is a branding - a strategy that elevates Symbol above NIS1 XEM is important. However, the name NIS1 does not have general acceptance. Since NEM means the New Economy Movement, it is also incorrect to brand NIS1/XEM and Symbol/XYM as separate from the NEM. In other words, we need to make sure that what people associate with the word NEM lands on XEM and XYM in a way that is easy to understand, and that there is a strong association between NEM and Symbol. My suggestion for the naming is as follows Change the name to XEM = NEM Classic. Change the logo image to a new one. Change the name to XYM = NEM Symbol. XYM = NEM Symbol, no change in logo image. The NEM logo coverage XEM and XYM will remain unchanged. It would be similar to the relationship between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Define XEM as clearly previous one and do not link the logo image to NEM. Making the image of XYM more linked to NEM. And yet, XEM and XYM should be identifiable as NEM. This is important.
----------------

**进一步的更改只会造成额外的混乱。这取决于您可以使用 Symbol 获得多少个大型项目。**

* Any change will only cause unnecessary confusion and will depend on how many huge projects we can win using Symbol.
-------------
**Symbol 作为 Symbol 应该是独立的，最好单独创建一个推特和网页，以及单独的联系方式。如果您想使用 Nem 的名称，您不必先将其从 Nem 中删除。您应该停止在 Symbol 上使用 NEM 品牌并尝试激发 Symbol 品牌，因为它只会让您感到困惑。Nem 不应按原样重命名。除了失去这个名字别无选择。**

* Symbol should be independent as Symbol, it's better to separate Twitter, website and contact form. If you want to use the name of nem , you don't have to remove nem from the first. They should stop using the Nem brand for Symbol as it's just confusing and let the Symbol brand flourish. The nem should remain the nem and not be renamed. It's only a loss because it will ruin the recognition of its name.
------------
**请创建一个 Symbol Metaverse！**

* Please create a Symbol Metaverse!
---------------
**（关于 NEM、Symbol 的个人看法）我认为在现实世界中拥有功能和需求比品牌更重要。你应该更系统、更有策略地、更聪明地。我非常赞成权力下放。无论您的系统有多好，几乎不可能在全世界使用它。比特币和其他战斗现在正在世界上进行，以压榨现有资金。考虑一下。即使现有的货币体系不复存在，也需要货币。所以我们需要赚更多的钱。是我们，而不是国家或企业，需要赚很多钱。我认为我们需要一个机会让持有者赚更多的钱。我认为货币也需要像去中心化金融这样的银行产生更多功能和货币的货币。（我个人对DHP空投的有无收获，无论拥有多少，印象深刻。）我认为未来的世界是不平等的。它不是那些有钱或拥有大量财产的人可比的。但我认为如果有机会，人们会走到一起。我相信对于很多人来说，Symbol 比去中心化金融带来更多的好处。<关于 NEM 集团包括logo的设计> 目前看来，社区中对设计有好感的人并不多。你需要一个像以太坊这样复杂的成品设计。（关于社区） 社区的意见很重要，但那些认为管理层被社区意见所左右的人感觉不专业。**

* (Personal opinion of NEM,Symbol) It is more about functions and being needed in the real world than branding. You should be more systematic, more strategic and smarter. I totally agree with Decentralisation. No matter how good the system is, if it is not used in the whole world, thus, means nothing. Now, there are battles going on in the world to break the existing money system, starting with BTC. But just think about it. Even if the existing money systems are destroyed, we still need money. So we need to make more money. And we need to make it richer, not countries or companies. I believe that holders need much more opportunities to gain much more profits. I think we need things such as Defi which have functions more than banks and some systems like money generating money as well. (Personally, I liked the fact that DHP airdrops were based on whether each wallet record had been harvested or not, regardless of the amounts of staking) I believe that the real world has never been and will never be equal. Richs, huge amounts stakers are not equal as general citizens. But I think the opportunities are what attracts people. I believe that Symbol will bring more benefits than Defi to many people. (About designs of NEM Group, including the logo.) Currently, it seems that few people in the community are good at designing, having a sense of design. We need a sophisticated and complete design like Ethereum. (About community) Listening to the community is important, but if the management is influenced by the opinions too much, it might be seen as less professional.
---------------

**NEM 是精神、技术、哲学等等。Symbol 是一个品牌。所以，NEM 的 Symbol 是描述它们之间关系的正确方式。 NIS1 只是 NEM 基础架构服务器之类的缩写，而且，我没想到NIS1是一个品牌。**

* NEM is spirit, technology, philosophy and so on. Symbol is a brand. So, Symbol from NEM is the right way to describe the relationship between them. NIS1 is just an abbreviation of NEM infrastructure server one or something like that, and, I have never thought that NIS1 is a brand.
---------------
**不要只改变你的优势！!! 不要妥协！**

* Never change only our strengths! I don't want you to compromise!
------------
**我认为 XYM 和 XEM 应该以 9 比 1 的比例标记，优先考虑 XYM。上市速度很慢，所以我认为我们应该努力。请在网站上发布，以便您可以看到 Sveteno 项目的进度。持有者是支持者。请珍惜。**

* Priorities XYM 9 of 10, XEM 1 of 10. I think XYM should be branded as the priority. Listing is slow, so I think you should work harder to encourage exchanges to list it. Please publish the progress of all of the projects on your website. Holders are your supporters. Please take good care of them.
--------------
**我认为Trest先生的计划是最好的。**

* I think Mr. Trest's idea is the best.
-----------
**首先，我认为它会在尽可能多的交易所上市。**

* The first step is to get listed on as many exchanges as possible! NEM/XEM shall be changed to NIS1 from NEM/XEM. Symbol from NEM/XYM is no change.
-------------
**Symbol 这个词不是独一无二的。这使得新朋友更难接触。技术上，XYM>XEM，所以应该呼吁 NEM 项目的区块链技术有所改进。总之，NEM 的主链已经重生。XEM 的技术在遵循 XYM 之后得到了极大的改进。但是，XEM 不会消失，它会更新为与主链 XYM 合作的子链。**

* The word "symbol" is not unique.This makes it harder for new people to reach them.Technically, XYM > XEM, so it should show that the NEM project has improved blockchain technology.In other words.NEM's main chain is newly revamped. XEM's technology has been followed by XYM, which is much improved.However, XEM will not disappear, but will be linked to the main XYM chain as a sub-chain, and will be updated within it.
-----------
**正确推广 Symbol！**

* Promote Symbol properly!
-----------
**从全球的角度来看，没有对 Symbol 的认可。在很多情况下，NEM 被认为比 Symbol 更好。NEM 品牌已更改为 XYM 和 XEM 的标志性品牌定位。请向全球传达，主角是 Symbol。**

* There is no global recognition of Symbol, NEM is known better than symbol in some cases. So NEM brand should be changed to the symbolic brand position of XYM and XEM. I want your announcements globally that Symbol is the main role.
-----------
**目前，许多交易所已经编写了 NEM，而不是应该编写为 NIS1 的内容。上面没有Symbol的时候没有什么特别的问题，但现在我认为这是识别错误的原因之一。但是，我知道要纠正所有这些问题并不容易。问题是NEM中有两条链（NIS1和symbol），很多人误以为NEM=NIS1。为了以一种可以实现的方式解决这些问题，在NEM的框架外显示Symbol是有效的。让它看起来像 2 个项目中有 1 个链而不是 1 个项目中有 2 个链会更简单，例如“NEM 中的 NIS1，Symbol中的Symbol（临时）”而不是“NEM 中的 2 个链”。作为一个具体的方法，1）创建和运营一个符号信息传输（Twitter等）的仅限符号的帐户2）不要使用NEM这个词进行符号信息传输（hashtag等）等。我们认为相互信息和认知可以通过分别操作符号来正确传达。**

* Currently many exchanges are using NEM when they should use NIS1. When there was no Symbol, not a problem, but now we believe that this is one of the reasons for the misunderstanding. However I know that it is not easy to correct all of this. The problem is that there are two chains in the NEM (NIS1 and Symbol) and lots of people mistakenly think that NEM = NIS1. To solve this point in a feasible way, I think it would be good to take Symbol out from the NEM. Instead of "2 chains in NEM", rather say simply "NIS1 in NEM, Symbol in Symbol (temporary)", represent 1 chain in each of the 2 projects, instead of 2 chains in 1 project. There are specific ways to.. E.G. 1)Create and operate a symbol focused account (e.g. Twitter) for disseminating symbol information. 2)Refrain from using the word NEM in any of Symbol's announcement (e.g. hashtag) and so on. I believe that it is important to keep the Symbol separate from the NEM, and each information will be conveyed properly.
-------------

**进一步命名 Symbol 只会造成混乱和摩擦。・ Symbol 和 NIS1 都来自 NEM ・ Symbol 是第二代 NEM，性能很高。 ・ NIS1 是第一代 NEM。你所要做的就是给出一个解释，把所有这些信息都推出去。再强调一点，Symbol 是主链。我厌倦了时尚和神秘的元素。**

* Further naming change of Symbol will only bring confusion and conflicting ・Symbol and NIS1 are same, both from NEM ・Symbol is the second generation of NEM, up-warded and more powerful ・NIS1 is the first generation of NEM That's all. The only thing that officials should do is to give a full explanation with this information. Should emphasise more the fact that Symbol is the main chain. I'm fed up with the fashionable and mysterious elements.
-------------

**Symbol 在开发上具有很高的自由度，可以用于任何东西，但它与其他货币的区别是模糊的。 我希望在各个领域看到更多用例，首先，从最有用的用例开始（从开发人员和企业的角度来看，不可见引入它的优点将是一个原因，尽管集成取决于公司的决定）。**

* Symbol has a high degree of freedom in development and can be used for anything, but it is obscure what's a difference from other currencies. I would like to see more use cases in various fields, firstly, starting with the most useful use cases (this, from developers and enterprise view not visible the merits of introducing it would be a reason, that integrations are up to the companies decisions though)
------------

**我觉得 NEN，Symbol 没有被认可。更多地向交易所和公司推广​​。现在是停止NGL内斗的时候了。**

* I feel that NEN, Symbol are not being recognised. Promote more to exchanges and companies. And it's high time to stop infighting in NGL.
-----------
**我不明白为什么我要放弃 NEM 品牌。即使有黑客攻击，NEM / XEM 也没有问题。NEM 品牌有着悠久的历史，所以你不应该因为一个错误就放弃它。品牌重塑后，我们必须从头开始建立信任。目前，我认为 XYM 没有这样的空闲时间。像 Uniswap V3 一样简单地使用 NEM v2 / XYM 不是可以吗？我想那个人会收到的。不必要的复杂会使新进入者感到困惑。首先，它比品牌重塑更受欢迎。与其像这样摩擦内环，不如在NFT、DeFi等其他链落后的领域加强技术和客户。你重新组织多少次，你犯了多少次同样的错误？即使是基本的性能，比如 6000 的符号 Tx/s，也并不为大众所熟知，即使你坚持这个名字，也不会改变。请在传播 Symbol 和改善基础设施后重塑品牌。多边形 (MATIC) 就是一个很好的例子。Polygon 巩固了 NFT 和 ETH 桥梁，并在稳定后更名。**

* I don't understand why I want to abandon the NEM brand. Even though there was a hack, it wasn't NEM/XEM's fault, the NEM brand has a history and shouldn't be let go by just one mistake. Once the rebranding is done, we have to start building trust again from zero. We don't think XYM has the time to do that at the moment. Why don't you simply say NEMv2/XYM like Uniswap V3? I think it would be more acceptable with everyone. Making things unnecessarily complicated will confuse newcomers. The first thing to do is to spread Symbol before rebranding. Instead of internal wrangling, should work on the technology and customers in areas where talking behind other chains, such as NFT and DeFi. How many times do we have to re-organise and make the similar mistakes over and over again, even the basic performance of a symbol, such as Tx/s of 6000, is not properly known to the public? Before thinking about rebranding, please promote Symbol and develop its infrastructure. Polygon (MATIC) is a good example which rebranded itself after consolidating and stabilising NFT and ETH Bridge.

**如果 NEM (NIS1) 是 Symbol 的子链，那么 Symbol 应该以 NEM 命名，NIS1 应该以不同的方式命名。我认为这个名字最容易理解，因为与日本相比，它在海外的知名度和理解度太低了。请清楚告知连接主链 Symbol 的许多子链的关系。如果您有未来的路线图，请披露。**

* If NEM (NIS1) is a sub-chain of Symbol one day and it's planned, Symbol should be named after NEM and NIS1 should be named differently. I think that the clear naming is the best way to make it easier to understand, because the awareness and understanding abroad is too poor when compared with Japan. I would like to know about sub-chains connected to the main chain symbol more clearly. If there is any roadmap, please disclose it.
----------
**NEM 和 Symbol 不兼容，毫无疑问，社区是没有前提的划分的，没有必要强行连接它们。如果你真的想坚持 NEM，你应该把刚刚诞生的 Symbol 命名为 NEM2 之类的。如果你真的想给它打上烙印，请把它命名为 NEM2 或类似的名字。即使我还没有准备 NIS1 文档，坚持使用 NEM 是荒谬的。**

* NEM and Symbol are incompatible and the community is definitely divided.There's no need to force two merges. If you really want to stick to NEM, you should change the name of the fledgling Symbol to NEM2 or something like that, but you don't want to change it. You say it's 'too late'. If you're serious about branding, make it NEM2 or something like that.　You can still start over. I mean, you haven't maintained the even documentation for NIS1, but it's ridiculous that you're forcing yourself to stick with NEM.

**谁是此次品牌重塑提案和讨论的协调员，担任什么职位？天然气？核心脂肪？海盗？基于这次讨论，您打算通过什么样的过程来决定品牌重塑的方向？是黑箱会议吗？是社区投票吗？如果你要在社区投票，你如何决定候选人？（我已经厌倦了 Symbol 或 Sekoya 等糟糕的选择。）要重塑品牌，我认为有必要重新创建网站，重新创建文档等，并联系交易所。这些工作由谁来做，在什么地方做位置？**

* Who is proposing this rebranding, and is in charge of organising the discussion? NGL? Core devs? Pirates? After this discussion, what process do you plan to use to decide on the direction of the rebranding? Is it a closed meeting? A community vote? And If you are going to have a community vote, how will you decide which candidate to choose? (I'm sick of choices that are both bad, like Symbol or Sekoya. choices we had) The rebranding process, re-designing of the website, re-documentation and managing with the exchanges will be required, but who will be in charge of this?

**Kunoichi是女忍者的名字，我认为它的敏捷、技术、轻盈和美丽很符合形象。**

**在Symbol 推出之前，你有没有很好的机会讨论它？我认为。尽管 NEM=NIS1 的形像已经在世界范围内生根发芽，但这种喧嚣本身只是中心化的感觉，我认为这是对区块链的一个负面影响。NEM 经典（NIS1）和 NEM（Symbol）更容易理解是可以理解的，但这是一个品牌问题吗？**

* You did have enough time to discuss this before the Symbol launch. Even though the image of NEM = NIS1 has been established in the public mind, the whole mess itself feels centralised, which I think is a negative for a blockchain. It's understandable that something like NEM classic (NIS1) or NEM (Symbol) would be easier to understand, but is it a branding issue?
-----------

**我们期待增加 NEM (XEM) 和 XYM 的价值。**

* I'm looking forward to seeing the value of NEM (XEM) and XYM increase.
---------
**我认为我们应该更常把 Symbol 带出并吸引人。大多数人不会熟悉 Symbol，即使他们熟悉，也感觉它们被视为比特现金和以太坊经典等。我敢肯定，有些人一开始并不了解 Symbol。必须清楚地表明，Symbol 作为主区块链已经换代了，而 NIS1 已经转向了子区块链。**

* I think you should appeal Symbol more at the forefront of the brand. Most people don't know much about Symbol, and even if they know it, they probably take it kind of a subordinate to Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, etc. There are people who don't even know what Symbol is.

**“NEM”而不是 XYM ，但你应该使用“NEM”而不是 XYM。**

**无论听起来多么好，谈论史诗般的未来，当前的图表都说明了整个故事。对 XEM、XYM 和 NEM 项目感到失望。整个市场的预期较低。我不觉得在其他项目中看到的绝望。不逃避现实，兼顾发展与提升。即使你有一定的技术技能，我认为你现在的立场也不能吸引很多人**。

* No matter how much we talk about a grand future, the current chart says it all: disappointed with XEM, XYM and the NEM project. Markets have low expectations. But I don't feel the desperation that is often sawn in other projects. Please keep an eye on reality and balance development and promotion. Even if the technology is solid, I don't think you can attract many people with your current stance.
-----------

**NIS1 这个名字在 Symbol 推出之前就已经有很强的 XEM/NEM 形象了。我认为虚拟货币交易所的名称也有影响。目前我觉得那个 Symbol 应该是主链，所以我觉得有必要统一 XEM 链的名称和虚拟货币交易所的名称。如果重生为 Symbol 的子链，我觉得是从 NIS1 改名的好机会。**

* The name NIS1 was strongly associated with XEM/NEM before the launch of the Symbol. I think that the name may also be influenced by the names of virtual currency exchanges and so on. If NIS1 is to be reborn as a sub-chain of Symbol, it would be a good opportunity to change the name from NIS1.
----------
**基本上，我们支持现有的，但如果你想改变一些东西，你可以制作 NIS1 标志，并在销售办事处和交易所使用 NIS1 XEM Symbol而不是 NEM XEM。我认为可能是这样。或者我认为，让 Symbol 成为比 NEM 更高的品牌，把 NEM、NIS1 作为 Symbol 的子链之一。**

* Basically, I'm in favour of keeping things the way they are, but if there were to make any changes, I think it would be better to make a new NIS1 logo, and if we called it NIS1/XEM instead of NEM/XEM on the exchanges. Alternatively, Symbol could be a higher brand than NEM, and NEM and NIS1 could be one of Symbol's sub-chains.
-----------
**我知道并购买 XEM 的原因是因为我知道 Symbol (XYM)。XYM 的收获收入和出售时的资本收益对我来说是一个钩子，让我产生了兴趣。我很期待 Symbol 未来的创新。我还没有足够的知识，但只要我在投资，我希望我能学习并为 XYM 和 XEM 的发展做出贡献。**

* The reason I bought XEM is, I found out about Symbol (XYM) , knew the harvesting income and the capital gain from selling it hooked me and got me interested. I am looking forward to the innovations that Symbol will bring to the market. I am still learning, but as long as I am investing, I hope to learn more and contribute to the development of XYM and XEM.
-----------

**Symbol 不是 NIS1。**

* Rather Symbol than NIS1
-----------

**知名厂商都有过往的故事，背书多年，但 Symbol 却没有这样的故事。此外，故事不是由主办方创造的，但支持者通过产品聚集并自然发生的强烈。一个品牌不是用来炫耀的，而是用来背书的。
**

* Famous brands have a story to tell and have been supported for many years, but Symbol has no such story yet. But, the story is not created by the organiser, by the product itself. A brand is not something to be flaunted, it is something to be supported.
-----------
**使用链名称 NEM Classic 和 NEM Symbol 是个好主意。最好让附近的人一眼就知道 NIS1 是较老的链。**

* It is better to name NEM Classic and NEM Symbol. It would be better if cryptor outside of NEM can see at a glance that NIS1 is the older chain.
-----------
**NEM=XEM 的形象领先于大众，Symbol 作为主链的形象弱。乍一看真的很难理解，即使您快速浏览或收到解释。我想很多人都觉得 Symbol / XYM 不为人熟知，误解无处不在，结果是 NEM，而不是 Symbol，在价格上领先。结果，我想如果我烧了 XEM，我就可以做到没有这样的误解。我认为品牌化也很重要，但不管怎样，（1）Symbol 是主链，（2）NEM 是子链，以及（3）双方未来将如何使用。我认为重要的是继续.我认为这很难。 NGL也将被拆除，因此非常感谢您的长期活动。我们支持工程师，让他们以后可以全身心投入到开发中，不以利润为先！ !! !! !!我们期待 Symbol 被广泛使用、交易飞扬、工程师得到奖励的那一天。**

* There is a prevailing image of NEM as XEM. And Symbol as the main chain is weak. The lack of awareness of Symbol/xym has led to misunderstandings everywhere, and as a result, many people have felt the dilemma of NEM being ahead in price instead of Symbol. I think that if we had burned xem as a result, we could have done without these misunderstandings. I think branding is important, but anyway, now ①Symbol is a main chain ②NEM is a sub chain ③How will both will be used in the future I think it's important to communicate these clearly and to continue to do so. I know it's not an easy job, and I'm sorry to hear that NGL will be closed, so thank you for all your hard work over the years. I wish you all the best and hope that the engineers will be able to put all their efforts into development in the future. ！！！！
-------------

**我想很多人在不知道 Symbol 和 NIS1 之间的区别的情况下购买 XEM 或 XYM。似乎“似乎有什么新的惊人的链诞生了！好吧，让我们购买这个 XEM 等等！”之类的事情实际上正在发生。您应该从 NIS1 中删除名称 NEM 或使其类似于 NEM Classic。**

* I suppose many people buy XEM or XYM without knowing the difference between Symbol and NIS1. "New amazing chain Symbol has launched! Okay, I'll buy XEM!" like this kind of lack of knowledge. NIS1 should be removed the name of NEM or change it to NEM Classic etc.

**技术再好，不使用也没有意义。**

**XYM 是 Symbol，XEM 是 NEM，就是这样。从今以后不要退缩。我对 Symbol 有很高的期望，但是为了增加 Symbol 的价值而相对降低 NEM / XEM 的价值的品牌是错误的。我认为应该加快 Symbol 的传播，并尽早实现与 XEM 的合作。**

* xym is Symbol, xem is NEM, that's it. Please don't degenerate now. I am counting on Symbol, but diminishing the relative value of nem/xem in order to increase the value of symbol, is not a good way of branding scheme. I think you should hurry up and promote the usage of Symbol and make it work with xem as soon as possible.

**(NEM) NEM (NIS1) / XEM Symbol / XYM 我们不应该尽最大努力让大家知道吗？我觉得除了日本以外的国家都没有做出足够的努力来让他们知道。我认为更改名称不是一件简单的事情。在 Catapult 品牌提案的时候，品牌名称 Symbol 从一开始就决定了，社区别无选择，只能批准或不批准。虽然 Symbol 是通过投票选出的，但日本社区花了很长时间才接受这个品牌名称。**

* (NEM) NEM(NIS1) / XEM Symbol / XYM Why don't you make a steady effort to make this known? I feel that countries other than Japan are not making enough effort to have this known. Just changing the name will not solve the problem. When the Catapult branding proposals At the time, the brand name Symbol had been chosen from the outset and the community had no choice but to approve it or not. After a vote, Symbol was chosen. It took a lot of time for the Japanese community to accept this brand name.
----------

**作为投资者，我对这一系列事件感到非常失望。从出生到现在已经有四个月左右了，所以市场可能会原谅我，但对于 Symbol 或 NEM 来说，把这个案子拖得太久是不好的。它诞生时没有名字或品牌吗？你现在是在向社会征求意见吗？是诞生前就应该整理的内容，幼稚的管理让我心疼。即使技术再好，根据运营情况，未来也可能充满不确定性，不鼓励投资。如果您更改了名称，请尽快采取适当的措施。我查看了调查问卷的结果，但根据受访者是 XEM 还是 XYM，观点差异很大。征求意见是好的，但请理解受访者有不同的观点，收集数据。很难让所有受访者都满意，所以要适当选择和集中。当您听到 NEM 时，您可能对 XEM 和 XYM 都有深入的了解。通常，您可能会将其与 NEM = XEM 相关联。NIS1 仍然普遍未知。你认识多少普通投资者？把这一切都推过去并传播这个名字是否现实？如果太复杂，就会出现很多人不能正确理解的问题。如果过于复杂，会阻碍一定数量的投资者进行投资。这个问题对 Symbol 的企业使用有相当大的影响。名称和概念的追求必须在某处平衡。我担心如果强调名称或概念的正确性，Symbol 可能会变得复杂。分别支持 NEM/XEM 和 Symbol/XYM 是现实的，如果信息从不同的账户发送，可能会减少混乱。从 NEM 账户发送 Symbol 信息一直有一种强烈的不适感。我是来获取 Symbol 信息的，但是我必须把 XEM 信息看成一个集合。Symbol / XYM 已经在多个交易所。 它列在以后改名的时候，光是宣传改名是不够的，除非你向继续贴旧信息的媒体和交易所仔细说明，要求更正，在改名前我希望你决定并实施变更后的措施，以免信息造成进一步的误解、混淆和复杂性。**

* As an investor, I am very disappointed with this whole thing. It's only 4 months since we were born, so the market may just about forgive it, but it's not good for Symbol or NEM to let this go on too long. You have launched without final decision with names and branding? And now you want to solicit it from the community? This is the sort of thing that should have been sorted out before the launch and it is sad to see how poorly it has been managed. Even if the technology is good, the management will make us feel insecure about the future and discourage us from investing. If you are going to change the name, please do it quickly and appropriately. The results of the survey responses have a big difference in perspective between respondents who are on XEM or XYM side. It is good to solicit opinions, but please be aware of the different perspectives of the respondents and collect data accordingly. It is difficult to satisfy all respondents, so please be selective and focused appropriately. When people hear the word NEM, probably only people who know well about NEM associate it with both XEM and XYM if you understand it deeply. In general, you probably associate NEM with XEM. NIS1 is still unknown to the general public. How many ordinary investors know about it? Is it realistic to push it out there now and promote the name? If it is too complex, there will always be a problem of not being understood properly by many people and it can discourage some investors from investing at a constant rate. This problem also affects the enterprise adoption of Symbol too. The pursuit of names and concepts has to be balanced at some point. I am afraid that if we focus on the correctness of names and concepts, the notation will become more complex. Having separate NEM/XEM and Symbol/XYM would be a more realistic way to be, and preparing two accounts to tweet each information is less confusing to disseminate information. For a long time now, I have been very uncomfortable with the fact that Symbol information is sent from the NEM account. I look there to get information about Symbol, but I have to look at the XEM information as well. Symbol/XYM is already listed on several exchanges. If you decide to change the name in the future, it is not enough to simply announce that you have changed the name, but unless you carefully explain the change to the media and exchanges that continue to publish outdated information and ask them to correct it constantly, the information before the change will cause further misunderstanding, confusion and complexity more.

* The name NIS1 was strongly associated with XEM/NEM before the launch of symbol. I think that the name may also be influenced by the ticker symbol of crypto currency exchanges. I feel that the name of the XEM chain and the name of crypto currency exchange need to be unified, as we believe that symbol should be the main chain at present. If NIS1 is going to be reborn as a sub-chain of Symbol, I think it is a good opportunity to change the name from NIS1.

**Symbol 是太普通的词。 Symbol 在谈判和会议上听起来不好，我觉得这个名字并没有传达它的目的或使用方式。**

**激活 NEMHUB。增加任务，在任务中了解广泛收集的视频等。**

**与其重建品牌，我认为最好以通俗易懂的方式公开介绍结果，并在 Symbol 诞生后的阶段专注于解释和信息共享。就像采用罗氏一样，我们将传达引入公司的优点，并增加实际使用该链的公司数量。请使用它。我们将在可以披露的范围内披露案例研究和影响。尤其是对贸易相关公司的猛烈攻击。兼容性太好了。给“成人”一个商业型利润和销售增长工具的形象。NFT 领域的竞争者众多，似乎即使无人看管它们也会增长。斥资1亿打造内部分销系统的时代已经结束。一个聪明的公司使用虚拟货币机制来构建一个 Symbol 与 NEM 的理性系统。认为“虚拟货币=网路钓鱼”的“大人”难道不能打上烙印吗？如果仅限于日本，则可以通过使用供应链改革等补贴的公司可以引入的机制来促进引入。我认为如果发现国家利益会增加，国家会合作。我对业余意见感到抱歉。**

* Rather than rebuilding the brand, I think that the phase from now on, after the Symbol has been launched, should focus on publishing, explaining and sharing the results of the introduction in a clear way. Announce the benefits of corporate adoption, such as the adoption of Roche, and increase the number of companies that use the chain actually. It's all about enterprises using it. Show examples of how they have used it and how it works. We are particularly keen on companies in the trade sector. Publishing examples of past installations and their effects as far as you can. We are particularly interested in companies in the trade sector. I think it is the best match. The image of a commercial tool for increasing sales and profits, aimed at "business bases". There is a lot of competition in the NFT field and it will grow even if it is left alone. "The era of investing hundreds of millions in building their own distribution system is over. Smart companies are using the blockchain to build a rational system with symbol×nem." If the branding is like that, "business bases" who think that "crypto currency = fishy" may turn their attention to it. It is possible to promote the introduction of crypto currency in Japan by using a system that allows companies to use subsidies for supply chain rebuilding. I think the government would be more supportive if they knew that it would benefit the country. I apologise for my amateurish opinion.

* strong message that Symbol is the chain NEM (NIS1) evolved from. And also its track record as well.
---------
**你在胡闹什么？讲过几次品牌问题了... 困扰的核心在哪里？首先，这种说法仅仅是因为 Symbol 的价格低于 XEM 并且 XYM 持有者开始变得不耐烦了，不是吗？如果您将其命名为 NEM，您认为价格会上涨吗？是否期望 Symbol 流向 XEM？不是这样吗？首先，XEM/NEM 是次要货币，现在买 XYM 的人和我们一样。首先，就算有好的出资者出来也没有地方买。如果 Symbol 开始在各大交易所上市，得到认可，处理它的公司数量增加并被评估，价格自然应该超过 XEM。先有蛋还是先有鸡，但是如果你想提高价格，为什么不先专注于在交易所上架 XYM/Symbol 呢？?? ?? 我不认为单单上市就涨，但作为前提，除非有地方买，否则不谈。**

* What are you always messing about with? How many times talking about branding.... Where is the epicenter of all this confusion? Isn't the whole debate just about the fact that XYM price is lower than XEM, XYM holders are getting impatient? Do you think the price will moon if you name the NEM on it? Do you think people expect that XYM will be replaced by XEM? How can that be? XEM/NEM is also a minor currency and the only people who buy XYM currently are just curious people like us. Even if there is a good fundamental, there is no place to buy it. When Symbol starts to be listed on major exchanges, and will be recognized and valued by more and more enterprises, the price will naturally surpass XEM. It's kind of a question of eggs first or chickens first, but if you want to increase the price, why not focus on listing XYM/Symbol on exchanges first? I don't think it will raise just by listing it, but the premise is that if there's no place to buy, there's nothing to talk about.

**我支持，但我认为普通人使用它们而不知道它们是理想的。例如，我希望它成为其他虚拟货币无法做到的社交系统，例如当购买或汇款时日元变成 XYM，然后返回日元。 我是 Symbol 的粉丝，但我认为最理想的情况是让普通大众不用考虑 Symbol 就可以使用它。比如你买东西或转账时，你的日元会在不知不觉中被 XYM 取代我希望 Symbol 将成为其他虚拟货币无法做到的社会系统。**

* I'm a Symbol fan, but I think the ideal situation would be for the general public to use it without thinking of the Symbol. For example, when you buy something or transfer money, your Yen will be replaced by XYM before you know it, and it will be returned to Yen. I hope that Symbol will be a system for society that other virtual currencies cannot do.

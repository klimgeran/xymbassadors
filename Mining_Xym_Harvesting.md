# Mining Xym - Harvesting
```

```

Symbol allows you to passively mine XYM tokens, in the Symbol Wallet, similar to mining, this process is called "harvesting". It is safer than staking on exchanges, since you do not need to send your tokens to the exchange, and all your private keys are completely safe.

To start mining XYM, you need at least 10,000 XYM tokens. You need to delegate your rights to a node in order to receive a block reward. You can connect to Symbol Ru nodes, which operate 24/7 and are stable and secure Symbol nodes:
**1) NIS2.host**
**2) XYM007.host**

You can also connect to **#XYMAMBASSADOR** nodes:
https://github.com/symbol/xymbassadors/blob/main/miscellaneous/Contacts.md

Thus, you can receive block rewards on our nodes even if your computer is turned off. In addition, you do not need to worry about XYM mining being disabled as our nodes are online 24/7.

## How much can you earn from harvesting?

If you have about 10k coins, then you do not need to think that you will receive blocks every day, with +10,000 XYM, you will receive approximately 3 blocks per year (At the time of this writing, the complexity of the network will increase every year.) See tableüëá

If you want to receive a block every month, then you need at least 45,000 XYM - 50,000 XYM. Each node to which you delegate your authority will hold 25% of your income, and you will receive 75% of your income. It turns out that for each block, on our nodes, we keep + - 44 XYM for ourselves, and you get + - 121 XYM.

The system is estimated to provide a return on income of approximately 3% -4% for delegated harvesters. Blocks in Symbol are created every 30 seconds, so that transactions are confirmed quickly enough.

As stated in a tweet from the core developer of Symbol ‚ÄúJaguar0625‚Äù: ‚¨áÔ∏è

That harvesting on NGL nodes is disabled and does not work. Be sure to switch as soon as possible to another node for example: **[#XYMAMBASSADOR](https://github.com/symbol/xymbassadors/blob/main/miscellaneous/Contacts.md)**. Otherwise, you will no longer receive harvesting rewards.

You can download Symbol Wallet [HERE](https://github.com/symbol/desktop-wallet/releases).

Symbol uses a POS + consensus algorithm and calculates "importance" from three parameters, so your account can get a chance to accept a block based on:

1) Staking XYM coins

2) Symbol account activity

3) Run your own Symbol node

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional Important Information

**Harvesting not working?** During the opt-in (subscription) process, there was a function for adding VRF keys, if you did not add VRF keys, then harvesting will not work for you. Therefore, create a new Symbol account, transfer XYM there, wait 12 hours and the importance of your account will change and you can mine XYM. In the new VRF account, the keys are by default.

**What are VRF keys?** This is an output function that can be publicly cryptographically verified so that the output is pseudo-random. This function is called (testable randomness function).

**Are you not getting XYM for your harvesting?** The problem may be related to the small amount of XYM coins in your wallet, as we wrote above, you need 45,000 XYM - 50,000 XYM in order for you to receive at least 1 block per month. Also, switching from node to node when your status is üü¢ ACTIVE was never a good idea, as every time you switch nodes your ‚Äúprogress‚Äù is reset. Therefore, the decision is your number of XYM and the uptime of the node you are connecting to.

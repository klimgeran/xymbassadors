Please drop screenshots directly into this file, so that during the Town Hall, I can open this single doc to present all the brand expressions in one tab. 

By documenting the manner in which our brands are presented by 3rd parties, we can better understand the common language and understanding of those operating within the crypto ecosystem.

Cointelegraph has numerous indications of "NEM" being synonymous with "XEM"

Our own messaging for years implied that NEM = XEM:  There are still many of these crumbs on official sources.

If we can align our own brand messaging with what is already commonly understood, we can build upon all the literature that exists, avoid expensive and time consuming communications with 3rd parties, and overall create a clear branding environment in which both XEM and XYM can thrive. 

Conclusion:
With virtually every information source showing a singularity with "NEM" as a brand, and "XEM" as a coin, if the community decides to pivot away from this understanding, we can expect confusion of brand identity for an unknown period of time as we work with each information source to update their information. (Not to mention, we would need to update much of our own)

By documenting the manner in which our brands are presented by 3rd parties, we can better understand the existing brand messaging. The manner in which our brand is displayed by others shows how they interpret our branding, as well as how their customers are introduced to our brands.

Our own messaging for years implied that NEM = XEM:  There are still many of these crumbs on official sources.

NEM Flash:  
This is a blog run by a long time community member. I find this example particularly important, because in this post, he quotes a portion of the telegam pinned message from around the Symbol snapshot & launch. Even then, the message given was that NEM was a blockchain and synonymous with it's token, XEM. We also demonstrated that a new blockchain was going to be release, it has a new name - Symbol (XYM)

All of the top search results on youtube are videos demonstrating NEM and XEM as synonymous:

There are countless examples like this. Literally thousands of articles, blogs, and other pieces of information have been published indicating the sameness of NEM and XEM.

If we can align our own brand messaging with what is already commonly understood, we can build upon all the literature that exists, avoid expensive and time consuming communications with 3rd parties, and overall create a clear branding environment in which both XEM and XYM can thrive. 

Conclusion:
There is a strong commonality between the questionnaires. About 75% support putting brand focus on Symbol, and want to see more Symbol branded content, products, and use cases rather than have them NEM branded.

About 50% said they support rebranding "NEM", and 65% support rebranding "NIS1"
These results show that there is confusion about NEM and NIS1 branding within the NEM & Symbol communities. 

By reviewing the NEM & Symbol brand expression by 3rd parties, it is clear that the predominant view is of NEM being synonymous with XEM and Symbol synonymous with XYM.

Based on all the information collected, the suggested path forward looks like:

• NEM is the blockchain. XEM is it's native coin.  
• Symbol is the blockchain. XYM is it's native coin.  
• Put focus on Symbol brand building.  
• "NEM" will continue as a brand, but considering it is to be a subchain of Symbol, it is not deserving of brand focus.  
• "NIS1" is not to be a part of the branding. It is the name of the client, as catapult is the name of the Symbol client.  
• "NEM" can be used synonymously with "XEM", just as "Ethereum" is synonymous with "ETH". If someone says "I can pay you with Cardano" - we know they intend to pay with ADA.  
We want the same clarity with our brands. If someone says "I hold NEM" - it's obvious they have XEM. And if they ask "How can I stake Symbol" - It's clear the question is regarding XYM Harvesting. 
Likewise, when news about Symbol is released, it will be released as news about Symbol - Not as news "from NEM" or "by NEM"  
Even if some want that to be the case, there is no longer a primary NEM branded entity in which the news can be released by.   
  
The developers that built NEM also built Symbol. NEM is a part of the Symbol story, and always will be. The Symbol brand will build off that reputation - but we don't have to, and we can't, tell the entire story and history of something via branding.  
  
There was considerable support for a "rebrand" of NEM. Perhaps after the initial steps to advance Symbol branding, if they choose to, the community can explore what a rebrand of "NEM" or "NIS1" would look like.  
A rebrand may or may not include a name change. It could merely be an update to brand colors and imagery.  
  
Ultimately this would require community effort and funding to advance, taking into consideration the 100s of integrations, thousands of media articles, and countless other information pieces with existing NEM branding.

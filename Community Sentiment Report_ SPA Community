Q: (Translation) Do you associate the NEM Brand with NIS1 and Symbol? With NIS1 only? With Symbol only?

Results:

NEM= NIS1/XEM		| 11 votes

NEM= Symbol/XYM		| 12 votes

NEM= NIS1 & Symbol	| 23 votes

Analysis:
Half of the surveyees (23 out of 46) associate NEM to both NIS1 and Symbol as parent brand/ecosystem for NIS1 and Symbol. This is a natural answer in a close enviroment, where all of the population is familiar with the ecosystem info and how it´s structured.
Without Symbol the first option, NEM= NIS1/XEM, would be a healthy association and maybe it´s why we still have almost a quarter of the surveyed still thinking that. We still have to find out why the resting 25% thinks of NEM primarily as root of Symbol/XYM.

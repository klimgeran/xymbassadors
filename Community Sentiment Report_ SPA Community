Q: (Translation) Do you associate the NEM Brand with NIS1 and Symbol? With NIS1 only? With Symbol only?

Results:

NEM= NIS1/XEM		| 11 votes

NEM= Symbol/XYM		| 12 votes

NEM= NIS1 & Symbol	| 23 votes

Analysis:
Half of the surveyees (23 out of 46) associate NEM to both NIS1 and Symbol as parent brand/ecosystem for NIS1 and Symbol. This is a natural answer in a close enviroment, where all of the population is familiar with the ecosystem info and how it´s structured.
Without Symbol the first option, NEM= NIS1/XEM, would be a healthy association and maybe it´s why we still have almost a quarter of the surveyed still thinking that. We still have to find out why the resting 25% thinks of NEM primarily as root of Symbol/XYM.

Surveyees total: 26

Q01.- When you hear "NEM" do you first think...

18	| XEM
8	| XEM & XYM

Before Symbol, our ecosystem had just a single relationship: NEM -or NIS1- as a Blockchain and XEM as token ticker. It was a simple to understand and present, that´s why most of SPA-s retain that information and some can refer it as the recent messages put: One Ecosystem -NEM- and two Blockchains, each one with its ticker, XEM & XYM.
None of the questioned associated NEM with XYM.

----
02.- When you hear "Symbol" do you first think...

24	| XYM
2	| XEM & XYM

According to Q1, less people relates Symbol to XEM. It´s fair and normal that Symbol is much associated to its own ticker than NEM to XEM. The new NEMbers are more keen to know about Symbol and XYM, a main character in the recent Snapshot.

----
03.- Should "NEM" be rebranded?

15	| Yes
11	| No

Most of SPA-s think we should change the NEM brand. Maybe the Symbol branding is more appealing, or maybe see Symbol as a NIS1 2.0 and have split thoughts on changing the NEM brand.
Here´s an open commentary of the surveyees: "I'm new to the community, I started in 2020, (...) the name Symbol is more relevant. I think NEM is a chain that needs a rebranding to Symbol" (Timestamp: 21/07/2021 8:35:34)

----
04.- Should "NIS1" be rebranded?

22	| Yes
4	| No
As seen in the Q3 answer, SPA-s think the NEM-NIS1 relationship should be rebranded: 04 out of 05 people think so.

----
05.- Should "Symbol" be rebranded?

26	| No
All of the surveyed think Symbol should be kept. This finding could help understanding that Symbol is easier to associate with its ticker, XYM, than NEM with both subordinated relationships, NIS1-XEM and Symbol-XYM

----
06.- Which would you prefer to see more of?

23	| Symbol
3	| NEM
Almost 9 out of 10 SPA-s want to know MORE about NEM. Either they believe to "knowing enough" about Symbol or, as Symbol is the next evolution of the ecosystem, they want to know more about it.

----
07.- Which brand should be the Flagship brand? (Priority focus)

19	| Symbol
7	| NEM
1	| NIS1

If we think of a Flagship, this would be the main one that speaks on our ecosystem behalf. Symbol has been in the spotlight, so it claims novelty status, as 03 out of 04 SPA-s think.
Even so, a single surveyee pointed out NIS1 as the brand standard and responded, at the free comment section: "NIS1 forever!" (Timestamp 21/07/2021 2:07:18)

----
08.- Do you refer to Symbol as:
18	| Symbol
5	| NEM Symbol
3	| Symbol by/from NEM
1	| Symbol by/from NIS1

More people see Symbol as "Just Symbol" than the rest combined. This could help explaining why Symbol, per se, has better chance to become a succesful brand because it´s has less associated patterns to relate to.
The same surveyee who shouted "NIS1 forever!" answered that Symbol should be named "after" NIS1. So, this SPA-s may not know everything about how Symbol is related to NIS1 after all.

---
09.- How strongly do you feel about the branding direction we take?

1	| 8 votes
2	| 1 vote
3	| 7 votes
4	| 1 vote
5	| 2 votes
6	| 0 votes
7	| 1 vote
9	| 3 votes
10	| 2 votes

If we split the results in 02 parts, 1-5 "Caring less" and 6-10 "Caring more", only five SPA-s "Care more". On the other hand, 8 surveyees clicked on option 01, the top of "Don´t care at all" position. 21 people favour the "Care less" option in total. This shows that the SPA-s are more relaxed regarding this matter.


10.- Translated Free comments:

* "NIS1 forever!" (Timestamp 21/07/2021 2:07:18)
* "I'm new to the community, I started in 2020, and I think the name Symbol is more relevant. I think NEM is a chain that needs a rebranding to Symbol" (Timestamp 21/07/2021 8:35:34)
* Feed us more on NEM News (Timestamp 21/07/2021 9:42:24)
* Excelent project (Timestamp 21/07/2021 9:43:09)
* I have followed NEM since 2018. It seems to me to be a serious project, from the technological perspective but messy and inconsistent in its philosophy. There was a time that they organized meetups (I live in Chile), then it moved to business focus and now to open source. Creating a successful brand helps a lot, true, but it's not a collective decision to make. It´s up to experts who then help plan marketing the product, coming from the community or hired. As a Brand, Symbol is brilliant and I think it needs to be promoted so much more (Timestamp 22/07/2021 20:45:46)

Q: (Translation) Do you associate the NEM brand with NIS1 and Symbol? Is there only NIS1? Only Symbol?

result:

NEM = NIS1/XEM | 0 votes

NEM = Symbol/XYM | 6 votes

NEM = NIS1 & Symbol | 3 votes

Analysis: (6 out of 9 people) connected NEM with Symbol and XYM, and 3 people associate NEM with NIS1 and Symbol. This is the natural answer in a closed environment, where all the population knows the information and structure of the ecosystem. If there is no symbol, the first option NEM = NIS1/XEM will be a healthy association of NIS1/XEM. At present, it seems that the community can’t distinguish the brand. Not so, generally a common popular NEM = Symbol/XYM, but roughly Can distinguish

Total number of respondents: 17

01.- When you hear "NEM", the first thing you think about...

16| XEM 
1 | XEM & XYM

In the previous Symbol, our ecosystem had only one relationship: NEM-or NIS1-blockchain, XEM was the only NEM token at that time.

02.- When you hear "Symbol", the first thing you think of...

3 | XEM 
7 | XYM 
7 | XEM & XYM

Observing now, in the market recently, there is still a state of development for NEM projects. I am very ignorant of this development. It is very important to know the child, XEM and XYM.

03.-Should "NEM" be renamed?

6 | Yes 
11| No

The current market friends all love the life NEM brand. It is a brand for many years and a deeply cultivated person. I personally don’t know it, I can only recognize it.

04.-Should "NIS1" be renamed?

9 | Yes 
8 | No 

From the answer, it can be said that in the past, the market friends think that it should be renamed to NEM-NIS1. There are also some who hope that it will not be changed. For reference

05.- Should "Symbol" be renamed?

17 | No

All respondents believe that Symbol should be retained. It is found that an accurate understanding of Symbol is easier to associate with the stock code XYM, and the market consensus will not change

06.- Which do you prefer to watch?

9 | Symbol 
7 | NEM

It seems that he has his own supporters. I hope I "understand" Symbol, because the symbol is the next evolution of the ecosystem, and I hope more people can understand it.

07.-Which brand should be the flagship brand? (Priority focus)

8 | Symbol 
9 | NEM

If we think of the flagship, it will be the main representative of our ecosystem. Symbol, which has always been popular under the spotlight, therefore believes that there will be new sexual opportunities, but believes that the market also likes NEM as its flagship brand, but in response to future development, it is the best development to use Symbol as the main development.

08.- Do you use Symbol as follows: 

7 | Symbol 
9 | NEM Symbol
1 | Symbol NEM

More people regard NEM Symbol as a "Symbol". This can help explain why a symbol might become a successful brand, because its association patterns are different, although it seems that there are people who like Symbol and NEM symbols and need to be more clearly distinguished

09.- What is your view of the brand direction we have taken?

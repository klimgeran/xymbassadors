Q: (Translation) Do you associate the NEM Brand with NIS1 and Symbol? With NIS1 only? With Symbol only?

Results:

  NEM = NIS1/XEM        | 0 votes
  NEM = Symbol/XYM      | 6 votes
  NEM = NIS1 & Symbol   | 3 votes


Analysis: (6 out of 9 people) connected NEM with Symbol and XYM, and 3 people associate NEM with NIS1 and Symbol. This is the natural answer in a closed environment, where all the population knows the information and structure of the ecosystem. If there is no symbol, the first option NEM = NIS1/XEM will be a healthy association of NIS1/XEM. At present, it seems that the community can’t distinguish the brand. Not so, generally a common popular NEM = Symbol/XYM, but roughly can distinguish

Surveyees total: 17

01.- When you hear "NEM" do you first think...

  16| XEM 
  1 | XEM & XYM

In the previous Symbol, our ecosystem had only one relationship: NEM-or NIS1-blockchain, XEM was the only NEM token at that time.

02.- When you hear "Symbol" do you first think...

  3 | XEM 
  7 | XYM 
  7 | XEM & XYM

Observing now,there is still a state of development for NEM projects in the market recently. I am very ignorant of this development. It is very important to know what is XEM and what is XYM.

03.- Should "NEM" be rebranded?

  6 | Yes 
  11| No

The current market friends all love the NEM life brand. It is a brand for many years and a deeply cultivated person. I personally don’t know it, I can only recognize it.

04.- Should "NIS1" be rebranded?

  9 | Yes 
  8 | No 

From the answer, it can be said that in the past, the friends in the market think that it should be rebranded to NEM-NIS1. t is a brand of years. It supports long-lasting people want to keep NEM name, I think this is very important.

05.- Should "Symbol" be rebranded?

  17 | No

All respondents believe that Symbol should be retained. It is found that an accurate understanding of Symbol is easier to associate with the stock code XYM, and the market consensus will not to change

06.- Which would you prefer to see more of?

  9 | Symbol 
  7 | NEM

It seems that he has his own supporters. I hope I "understand" Symbol, because the symbol is the next evolution of the ecosystem, and I hope more people can understand it.

07.- Which brand should be the Flagship brand? (Priority focus)

  8 | Symbol 
  9 | NEM
 
It will be the main representative of our ecosystem. Symbol, which has always been popular under the spotlight, in response to future development, it is the best development to use Symbol as the main development.

08.- Do you refer to Symbol as:

  7 | Symbol 
  9 | NEM Symbol
  1 | Symbol NEM

More people regard NEM Symbol as a "Symbol". This can help explain why a symbol might become a successful brand, because its association patterns are different, although it seems that there are people who like Symbol and NEM Symbol and need to be more clearly distinguished

09.- How strongly do you feel about the branding direction we take?

Q: (Translation) Do you associate the NEM Brand with NIS1 and Symbol? With NIS1 only? With Symbol only?

問：您是否將 NEM 品牌與 NIS1 和 Symbol 聯繫起來？只有 NIS1 嗎？只有Symbol？


Results:

  NEM = NIS1/XEM          | 0 votes
  NEM = Symbol/XYM        | 6 votes
  NEM = NIS1 & Symbol     | 3 votes


Analysis: (6 out of 9 people) connected NEM with Symbol and XYM, and 3 people associate NEM with NIS1 and Symbol. This is the natural answer in a closed environment, where all the population knows the information and structure of the ecosystem. If there is no symbol, the first option NEM = NIS1/XEM will be a healthy association of NIS1/XEM. At present, it seems that the community can’t distinguish the brand. Not so, generally a common popular NEM = Symbol/XYM, but roughly can distinguish

分析：（9 人中有 6 人）將 NEM 與 Symbol 和 XYM 聯繫起來，3 人將 NEM 與 NIS1 和 Symbol 聯繫起來。這是封閉環境中的自然答案，所有人口都知道生態系統的信息和結構。如果沒有Symbol，第一個選項 NEM = NIS1/XEM 將是 NIS1/XEM 的健康關聯。目前，社區似乎無法區分品牌。不是這樣，一般常見的流行NEM=Symbol/XYM，但大致可以區分

（截至 2021 年 7 月 27 日日本時間 17:00）我們正在發布答案以及收到的意見的英文翻譯。此外，以英文收到的答復以及以日文和英文收到的答复按原樣張貼。
（有一個答案似乎沒有特定的順序或重複的答案）

為什麼您總是強調nem？ 在我的觀點，Symbol與XYM的命名不好，但現在已開始，我們應該盡力而為。

Why do you always keep stressing nem? In my opinion, Both naming of Symbol and XYM are not good, but now it has started, we should go ahead with it.

技術在不斷發展，我們需要加快速度推出品牌，否則會後悔。

Technology continues to evolve and we need to get our brand out there much faster, otherwise we'll regret the timing.

我們希望營銷品牌容易被大眾接受。

I expect your marketing and branding to be easily accepted (and understood) by the masses.

不要做任何額外的事情

Don't do anything you shouldn't.

觀察在日本的情況，尤其早期的 NEM 在“品牌化”方面取得了成功，因此沒有人特別注重品牌化。由於每個人都有獨特的設計理念，想像NEM的使用方案和未來，並且祈求投資成功，試圖以自己的方式傳達和傳播NEM。我認為這是創建去中心化經濟區需要學習的東西。然而不幸的是，我們覺得 Symbol 的命名過程有一半被強行推出。在當時 NEM 基金會代表的 Twitter 民意調查中，許多人想要“包含 NEM（專有名詞）的名稱”或“Catapult”的名稱，但提出都不是這兩者的名稱和標誌時，我們驚呆了:推出的是 Symbol。因為啟動經常被推遲，這暗示如果我們不同意這個想法，能更進一步推遲，我們把提前啟動放在首位，也認為應該這樣做，我們最好選擇在 PoI 投票中選擇“是”。儘管我們投票贊成，仍然推遲了一年多。這樣的背景是造成當前品牌混亂的過去事實。這不僅僅是你喜歡或不喜歡 Symbol 這個命名，或它是否合適。以上是我的想法。我終於習慣了 Symbol 這個名字，但我仍然對這個標誌不滿意: NEM 標誌是自由而且積極的，但 Symbol 標誌卻有某種壓抑感。除了熱情洋溢的NEMber，尤其在日本以外，似乎Symbol被理解為一種NEM的衍生幣或其他東西，目前仍沒有被廣泛地理解為 NEM 的升級版和 NEM 生態系統中的主鏈。
當然，造成這種情況的原因之一是人們不習慣變化，但很明顯，這是最初品牌的失敗。如果你仍然堅持品牌化，Symbol 現在已取代 NIS1 為 NEM 生態的主鏈，NIS1成為互補的子鏈。如果能傳達出強烈的信息，廣為人知，我認為沒有必要更改名稱。但是，如果社區的意願得出結論，最好重命名一個或兩個並重新開始，我認為這很好。無論是哪種結論，從現在開始都有一個負擔。太空海盜指南強調“破壞”，但如果你不害怕破壞，你可能還需要決心摧毀你的半生不熟的品牌。不，恐怕我們還沒有取得任何成就以至於害怕破壞。畢竟，對於那些成功地使用技術的公司或開發商來說，不會只選擇他們的品牌。我認為投資者也是如此。我認為技術將成為我們自己和其他人的解決方案。品牌閃耀是信任和成就的證明。最後，我們不負責選擇這種前所未有的雙鏈系統。這是核心開發人員和一些人在閉門討論後做出的決定。由於法定問題，我不得不使用兩條鏈。不要讓我們在這方面迷失太久。耐心是有限度的。

Talking about spotting in Japanese situation, branding success especially in the early stage of NEM was, there was no specific person who emphasized its promotion. Due to that each one empathized with the design concept in their own sense, each one dreamt about use cases and its future, and believed in the success of its investing, and has tried to communicate and spread the word about NEM in our own way. I think this is something that we need to learn about creating a decentralised economic venue. But, unfortunately we feel the naming process of Symbol was half-imposed. In a Twitter poll conducted by representatives of the NEM Foundation at that moment, lots of people wanted a name that included NEM (a proper noun) or "Catapult", but we were stunned when neither of these names and logos were proposed: it was Symbol. The situation was, the launch had been postponed so often, and it was implicated that if we didn't agree with the idea, it could be further postponed, and we decided that the best thing to do was to vote "yes" in the PoI poll, because an early launch was our priority and should it to be done we thought . Nevertheless we decided it would be best to vote "yes", but it was still delayed for over a year. This is a fact that these backgrounds that we had have caused the current branding confusion; it is not just a question of like or not like the naming of "Symbol", or being suitable or unsuitable for. This is what I think. Personally, I'm getting used to saying Symbol finally, but I still don't feel comfortable with the logo: the NEM logo was free and positive, but the Symbol logo has a certain oppressive feeling that I get uncomfortably. Except for enthusiastic NEMbers, especially outside of Japan, Symbol seems to be recognized as little more than a derivative of NEM or some extra, and there is still no widespread understanding that Symbol is an upgraded NEM and the main chain within the NEM ecosystem. I'm sure, part of the reason for this is that people are not used to such changes, although it is clear that this is a failure of initial branding. Even though you still insist on branding, make clear this point that Symbol has replaced NIS1 as the main chain of the NEM ecosystem, and NIS1 will be a complementary sub-chain of Symbol. If only the point will be widely known with a strong message to the public, I think that no need to change names is necessary. However, if the community chooses that the best thing to do is renaming one or both of them and starting again, then I'm fine with that. Either conclusion will be a burden to be borne in the future though. The Reflections of Space Pirates emphases 'destruction', and if you're not afraid of destruction, you may need to determine the courage to ruin your half-baked branding. Nevertheless we haven't achieved anything yet to fear its ruins. In other words, those who will succeed in using technology as companies or developers will not choose them only its brand alone. I think it's the same for investors. The point is, how technology can be a solution for them or someone else. A brand is a bright testimony of trust and performance. In conclusion, there ain't any responsibilities with the community for the decision to use the two-chain system, which has few precedents. The decision was taken after closed discussions between the core developers and some other people. Due to legal issues too, the 2 chain solution had to be chosen, even though we have understood that. But please don't keep us confused anymore. Patience will not last forever.



雖然還很新，但我認為“Symbol”這個名字是阻礙大家認識它的因素之一。它應該是一個獨一無二的名字。另外，我希望您停止為 NEM 投入大量資源。

After all this time now but Symbol, it should have given an one and only name. I think that the ordinary naun "Symbol" is one of the factors that hindered its recognition. Also, I would like to ask you to stop resourcing too much to NEM please.

老實說，從開發者的角度來看，無論是Symbol還是NEM都無所謂。不過，我接觸了Symbol和NEM技術，覺得很棒，所以支持。如果你能以完整易懂的方式向非技術人員解釋它就可以了。例如，當您想到比特幣時，每個人都會想到虛擬貨幣比特幣，對嗎？我覺得就是這麼簡單。說到 Symbol，就像 XYM。
NEM 是否成為 Symbol 的子鏈，對大眾來說並不重要。.. 另外，請豐富開發文檔。技術再好，沒人用也沒有意義。當前文檔缺乏用例，示例代碼被省略太多，難以閱讀。好像不是經常更新。如果你真的想增加開發者的數量，或者你想進行實際的社交實現，請讓文檔足夠詳細，讓初學者理解。

To be honest, from a developer's point of view, it doesn't matter whether it's called Symbol or NEM. Why do I support Symbol and NEM because I have been exposed to their technology and think it's great. If you can explain it to a non-technical person in a complete and clear way, that's fine. For example, when you hear Bitcoin, everyone thinks of the virtual currency Bitcoin, right? I think it's as simple as that. Like Bitcoin, if you heard Symbol, everyone imagines its native currency XYM. It doesn't matter if NEM becomes a sub-chain of Symbol or not, it's none of the public's business. And also, please enhance the development documentation more. No matter how good the technology is, it's useless if no one uses it. The current documentation is lacking in use cases and the example code is too abbreviated all the more, hard to read. It doesn't look like it's being updated often. If you really want to increase the number of developers and promote real-world social implementation, please make the documentation so detailed that even beginners can understand it.

NEM似乎有早期投資人稱之為核心團隊和信託的人，但請說明他們有多少，他們有多少收入，他們有什麼樣的決策權，我們不要求提供個人信息。如果要強調透明度，我認為這是第一步。這是因為他們的意圖似乎在之前 NEM 社區的基金決策以及 NEM 基金會和 NGL 的建立/運營中發揮了強大的作用。現在他們幾乎都失敗了，他們是否有辨別事物的能力是非常值得懷疑的。如果他們繼續擁有強大的決策權，我認為 NEM/Symbol 作為一個去中心化的地方將繼續薄弱，所以我認為我們也應該審查治理體系。我認為在多次被證明失敗後，通過關於品牌建設的膚淺辯論可以解決這個問題。

I heard that NEM has a core team of early investors and others, called the Trust. Please clarify how many people there are, how much importance they have and what decisions they have. We do not ask for personal information. If you want to emphasise transparency, that's the first place to start I think . Because they seem to have had a strong hand in the decision making of the former NEM Community Fund and in the creation/management of the NEM Foundation and NGL. Now that they have largely failed, it is highly doubtful that they have the ability to see things differently. And if they continue to be the major decision makers, then NEM/Symbol will continue to be weaker and further away from the decentralized philosophy, and the way of governance should be reviewed. After so many failures, I don't think a superficial discussion about branding is the answer.

說到NEM生態系統，應該讓 NIS1/XEM 以及 Symbol/XYM 有明顯的區別。遺憾的是，在目前的情況下，造成誤導的條款較多。我認為通過再次推出 NEM，NIS1 / XEM 和 Symbol / XYM 都會出現一個好時機。謝謝您的考慮。

If you are going to describe the NEM ecosystem, you should make a clear distinction between NIS1/XEM and Symbol/XYM.Now, disappointing that there are so many misleading statements. We believe that this would be a good moment for both NIS1/XEM and Symbol/XYM. Thank you for your consideration!

兩條鏈 NIS1 和 Symbol 令人困惑。許多人不知道 Symbol 是 NIS1 的重大更新。我認為盡快解決這個問題很重要。

Two chains NIS1 and Symbol bring a lot of confusion because there are now, and many people don't know that Symbol is a major update to NIS1. I think it is important to resolve this issue quickly.


它已經變得流行，因為 NEM = XEM，所以我認為在這裡說 NIS1 只會令人困惑。而且自從之前的盜竊事件之後，NEM 的形象仍然是負面的，所以我認為 Symbol 沒有必要敢把 NEM 帶到前台。作為新一代優秀的公鏈，如果 Symbol 被管理層和工程師知道，並且真正開始發生交易，我認為它會一下子傳播開來。（我希望這樣！）

The public already knows NEM as XEM, so it would be confusing to say NIS1 now. And since NEM still has a negative image from the past theft, I think Symbol does not need to put NEM in the forefront. As the new generation of the best public blockchains, I believe that once Symbol is known to enterprises and engineers, then transactions actually start to occur, it will spread rapidly. (I hope so!).


有沒有什麼大消息會影響市場價格？ Symbol 花了那麼多時間才最終發布，但知名度太低且交易量低。

Is there any big news that could affect the market price? Symbol had been taking a huge amount of time to finally release, but is too unknown and the trading volume is low.

我支持你。

I'm behind you.

如果是Symbol，請以 Symbol 形式披露整個表面的信息。確定 Symbol 新聞或 Nem Group 的 Symbol 新聞。

As far as information is concerned, if it is a symbol, please push the word ”symbol”. Symbol news, or symbol news by Nemgroup, is OK.

我期待提高對 Symbol 的認識！

I hope it will raise awareness of Symbol!

未能為新產品打上品牌後，重命名過去的產品是荒謬的。交易所對舊產品更名反應不順，就停止處理。將營銷成本（對營銷經理的獎勵）用於 Symbol 上市的交易所上市技術支持。

It is ridiculous to change the name of a past product after failing to brand a new product. Exchanges will not readily accept the renaming , they will just stop handling them. Spend the marketing reserve (remuneration for the head of marketing) on technical support for the Exchange's listing of the symbol.

我期待Symbol

I'm looking forward to the symbol!

我想讓你成為其中之一

I want them to be merged into one.

我期望 NEM 和 Symbol 的未來。我最初對 XEM 進行了長期投資，現在仍然如此。如果 XEM 是黃金，那麼 XYM 應該具有附加價值，例如白銀。除了 NFT 之外，我認為我們還需要世界上的人們從未想過使用的創新技術。我們將繼續支持 NEM 和 Symbol 的發展。我想同時投資 NEM 和 Symbol 的未來。

originally a long term investor in XEM and I still am. It would be nice, XYM being accepted as silver when XEM is gold. I also think that we need innovative technology that people around the world will want to use, not just NFT. I will continue to support the development of NEM and Symbol.

價格太低、太混亂。

Too much mess for a low price

我希望你在你的推特賬戶上放更多的 Symbol。環顧世界，我想大多數人都不了解 XEM 和 XYM 的關係。我認為重要的是每個人都能在瞬間理解以便傳播。我認為如果名稱易於每個人理解而不是困難的名稱，那麼 NEM 和 Symbol 的表現會有所不同。

I would like to see more symbol on Twitter account. I think that most people in the world don't understand the relationship between xem and xym, and to spread it, it's important to make it instantly understandable for everyone . I think it's important to make it easy for everyone to understand, and I think it would be different if the other performance parts of NEM and symbol were named in a way that everyone could understand, rather than difficult names.

我相信你。

I am trust you

我認為 NIS1 很難理解。

I think "nis1" is difficult to understand just because of its name.

不斷努力品牌推廣，增加交易量，從而對價格產生積極影響。

Please make a sustained effort to brand your business in order to increase transactions and have a positive impact on prices.

NEM 的名字太知名，Symbol 太不知名了。應該單獨標註。

The name of NEM is too strong and Symbol is too unknown. Should be branded separately.


聚合交易（Symbol）的有效期（2天）太短。我要你延長期限。

The validity period (2 days) of the aggregate transaction (Symbol) is too short. Make it longer please.

我希望 Symbol 是世界的一部份👍

I hope that symbol will become a part of the world👍


沒有人知道 Symbol，所以我認為這裡的NEM1（NIS1）和NEM2（Symbol）沒有任何問題。NEM在日本非常有名。NEM1 和 NEM2 不是好的地方嗎？

Not many people know Symbol I think. NEM is well known in Japan, so I suggest NEM1 and NEM2 is a good place to start. How about this?

不要忘記，投資者會為事物增值。換句話說，好的技術需要好的營銷。NEM 小組在地區的平衡非常糟糕。我承認技術，但我不認為我會再投資。另外，手機錢包為大家提供了一個輕鬆觸碰 Symbol 的機會，但它會留下虛假的跡象和缺陷多久呢？您應該嘗試找出並清除讓您感到那種草率的部分。

Please remember that things only become valuable when they have investors. NEM group has a very bad balance in this area. I appreciate the technology, but I can't see myself reinvesting in it. Also, how long will the mobile wallet, which is said that giving everyone easy access to Symbol, continue to be mislabeled and glitchy? Should work to identify and eliminate such sloppiness.

Nem 不是Symbol。Symbol不是 Nem。應該利用這兩個特徵來生存。

Nem is not Symbol; Symbol is not Nem. Both characteristics should be used to survive well.

我支持你們。

I support you guys.


我總是很感激你的幫助。我希望你繼續強調Symbol是主鏈。對於有興趣的用戶，如果您能採取一種鼓勵用戶積極開展公關活動的方式，更不用說技術跟進，我們將不勝感激。我期待著與您合作。
感謝大家的幫助，請繼續強調Symbol是主鏈，以這樣的方式接近感興趣的用戶，他們不僅會跟進技術，而且會想自己積極推廣。感謝您的支持為將來。

Thank you for all your help and please continue to emphasise that Symbol is the main chain and approach interested users in such a way that they will not only follow up on the technology but will also want to actively promote it themselves. Thank you for your support for the future.


如果你把 NEM 看作是 Symbol 的門戶，我認為有必要改變 NIS1 的品牌。

If we think of NEM as a gateway to Symbol, I think there's nothing to change the NIS1 brand.

請專注於擴展開發和用例不要說廢話

Stop such nonsense and focus on development and expanding use cases

對於內部討論和後續進展，請不要限制在 Discord 內部共享信息，也可以在 Twitter 等其他媒體上傳播。Discord 是一個任何人都可以進入的封閉空間，在日本還不是很熟悉。另外，在推特上，核心開發者以外的海外人士的呼聲越來越高，整個街區都開始被拉向那些聲音的方向，無論是好是壞。我希望你堅定地表明你作為日本的地位和存在感。

Discord, a closed space where anyone can join, and it's not very familiar in Japan. Please announce it on Twitter or other apps. Also, the voices of non-core developers are getting louder on Twitter, and the whole community tends to be pulled in the direction of those voices, for better or worse. I hope that Japan will show its position and presence.

Symbol 應該是“Symbol inside”，就像“intel inside”。是“New Economy Movement”，意思是“新經濟過渡”，而不僅僅是“未來的金融”。

The symbol should be "Symbol inside", like "intel inside".　Be "New Economy Movement", which means "transition to a New Economy", not just "finance of the future".

目前 NEM 在價值上是壓倒性的優勢，所以我覺得如果我們能用 NEM 名稱的價值來展示 Symbol 技術的高水平就好了。

At the moment, NEM is the dominant name in terms of value, so it would be good if we could use its name value to promote the high level of technology of Symbol.

在推廣 Symbol 作為主鏈時，一般形像明確為 NEM=XEM，而且由於 NEM 和 XEM 的logo形像是一樣的，所以 XYM 也被封裝在 NEM 的框架內，對 XYM 的識別將是一個 XEM 的紅利認可，XEM的一條子鏈的認可會更適合全世界。我認為消除這種形像是不可能的。這是一種品牌戰略。將 Symbol 升級到 NIS1 的 XEM 的品牌形象策略很重要。然而，NIS1 這個名字並沒有普遍的滲透性。這不應該誠實地使用。由於NEM的名稱是新經濟運動，我認為將NIS1 / XEM和Symbol / XYM與NEM分開的品牌策略也是不正確的。換句話說，需要讓與NEM的文字形象相關聯的內容以通俗易懂的方式登陸XEM和XYM，並且能夠強烈地聯想到NEM=Symbol。我的命名建議如下。-重命名為 XEM = NEM Classic。重新更改徽標圖像。- 將名稱更改為 XYM = NEM 符號。請勿更改徽標圖像。- XEM 和 XYM 周圍的 NEM 徽標圖像不會更改。是否接近以太坊和以太坊經典的關係？將 XEM 定義為明顯舊的，不要將您的徽標圖像與 NEM 鏈接。將 XYM 圖像與 NEM 鏈接。儘管如此，可以確定 XEM 和 XYM 是 NEM。這個很重要。

In promoting Symbol as the main chain, it is obvious that the general image of NEM = XEM has been established, and the logo of NEM and XEM are the same, so as long as XYM is in the frame of NEM, everyone's perception of XYM is that it is only a part of XEM, and the world may rather perceive it as a sub-chain of XEM.I think that dispelling this image is not an easy task. It is a branding - a strategy that elevates Symbol above NIS1 XEM is important. However, the name NIS1 does not have general acceptance. Since NEM means the New Economy Movement, it is also incorrect to brand NIS1/XEM and Symbol/XYM as separate from the NEM. In other words, we need to make sure that what people associate with the word NEM lands on XEM and XYM in a way that is easy to understand, and that there is a strong association between NEM and Symbol. My suggestion for the naming is as follows Change the name to XEM = NEM Classic. Change the logo image to a new one. Change the name to XYM = NEM Symbol. XYM = NEM Symbol, no change in logo image. The NEM logo coverage XEM and XYM will remain unchanged. It would be similar to the relationship between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Define XEM as clearly previous one and do not link the logo image to NEM. Making the image of XYM more linked to NEM. And yet, XEM and XYM should be identifiable as NEM. This is important.

進一步的更改只會造成額外的混亂。這取決於您可以使用 Symbol 獲得多少個大型項目。

Any change will only cause unnecessary confusion and will depend on how many huge projects we can win using Symbol.


Symbol作為Symbol應該是獨立的，最好單獨創建一個推特和網頁，以及單獨的聯繫方式。如果您想使用 Nem 的名稱，您不必首先將其從 Nem 中刪除。您應該停止在 Symbol 上使用 NEM 品牌並嘗試激發 Symbol 品牌，因為它只會讓您感到困惑。Nem 不應按原樣重命名。除了失去這個名字別無選擇。

Symbol should be independent as Symbol, it's better to separate Twitter, website and contact form. If you want to use the name of nem , you don't have to remove nem from the first. They should stop using the Nem brand for Symbol as it's just confusing and let the Symbol brand flourish. The nem should remain the nem and not be renamed. It's only a loss because it will ruin the recognition of its name.

請創建一個Symbol Metaverse！

Please create a Symbol Metaverse!

（關於NEM、Symbol的個人看法）我認為在現實世界中擁有功能和需求比品牌更重要。你應該更系統、更有策略地、更聰明地四處走動。我非常贊成權力下放。無論您的系統有多好，幾乎不可能在全世界使用它。BTC 和其他戰鬥現在正在世界上進行，以壓榨現有資金。考慮一下。即使現有的貨幣體係不復存在，也需要貨幣。所以我們需要賺更多的錢。是我們，而不是國家或企業，需要賺很多錢。我認為我們需要一個機會讓持有者賺更多的錢。我認為貨幣也需要比Defi這樣的銀行產生更多功能和貨幣的貨幣。（我個人對DHP空投的有無收穫，無論擁有多少，印象深刻。）我認為未來的世界是不平等的。它不是那些有錢或擁有大量財產的人可比的。但我認為如果有機會，人們會走到一起。我相信對於很多人來說，符號比 Defi 帶來更多的好處。<關於NEM集團包括logo的設計> 目前看來，社區中對設計有好感的人並不多。你需要一個像以太坊這樣複雜的成品設計。（關於社區） 社區的意見很重要，但那些認為管理層被社區意見所左右的人感覺不專業。

(Personal opinion of NEM,Symbol) It is more about functions and being needed in the real world than branding. You should be more systematic, more strategic and smarter. I totally agree with Decentralisation. No matter how good the system is, if it is not used in the whole world, thus, means nothing. Now, there are battles going on in the world to break the existing money system, starting with BTC. But just think about it. Even if the existing money systems are destroyed, we still need money. So we need to make more money. And we need to make it richer, not countries or companies. I believe that holders need much more opportunities to gain much more profits. I think we need things such as Defi which have functions more than banks and some systems like money generating money as well. (Personally, I liked the fact that DHP airdrops were based on whether each wallet record had been harvested or not, regardless of the amounts of staking) I believe that the real world has never been and will never be equal. Richs, huge amounts stakers are not equal as general citizens. But I think the opportunities are what attracts people. I believe that Symbol will bring more benefits than Defi to many people. (About designs of NEM Group, including the logo.) Currently, it seems that few people in the community are good at designing, having a sense of design. We need a sophisticated and complete design like Ethereum. (About community) Listening to the community is important, but if the management is influenced by the opinions too much, it might be seen as less professional.

NEM 是精神、技術、哲學等等。Symbol 是一個品牌。所以，NEM 的 Symbol 是描述它們之間關係的正確方式。
NIS1 只是 NEM 基礎架構服務器之類的縮寫，而且，我沒想到NIS1是一個品牌。

NEM is spirit, technology, philosophy and so on. Symbol is a brand. So, Symbol from NEM is the right way to describe the relationship between them. NIS1 is just an abbreviation of NEM infrastructure server one or something like that, and, I have never thought that NIS1 is a brand.


不要只改變你的優勢！!! 不要妥協！

Never change only our strengths! I don't want you to compromise!

我認為 XYM 和 xem 應該以 9 比 1 的比例標記，優先考慮 XYM。上市速度很慢，所以我認為我們應該努力。請在網站上發布，以便您可以看到 Sveteno 項目的進度。持有者是支持者。請珍惜。

Priorities XYM 9 of10, XEM 1 of 10. I think XYM should be branded as the priority. Listing is slow, so I think you should work harder to encourage exchanges to list it. Please publish the progress of all of the projects on your website. Holders are your supporters. Please take good care of them.


我認為特雷斯特先生的計劃是最好的。

I think Mr. Trest's idea is the best.

首先，我認為它會在盡可能多的交易所上市。

The first step is to get listed on as many exchanges as possible!
NEM/XEM shall be changed to NIS1 from NEM/XEM. Symbol from NEM/XYM is no change.

Symbol這個詞不是唯一的。這使得新人更難接觸。技術上，XYM>XEM，所以應該呼籲NEM項目的區塊鏈技術有所改進。總之，NEM的主鏈已經重生。XEM 的技術在遵循 XYM 之後得到了極大的改進。但是，XEM 不會消失，它會更新為與主鏈 XYM 合作的子鏈。

The word "symbol" is not unique.This makes it harder for new people to reach them.Technically, XYM > XEM, so it should show that the NEM project has improved blockchain technology.In other words.NEM's main chain is newly revamped. XEM's technology has been followed by XYM, which is much improved.However, XEM will not disappear, but will be linked to the main XYM chain as a sub-chain, and will be updated within it.

正確推廣Symbol！

Promote Symbol properly!

從全球的角度來看，沒有對Symbol的認可。在很多情況下，NEM 被認為比符號更好。NEM 品牌已更改為 XYM 和 XEM 的標誌性品牌定位。請向全球傳達，主角是Symbol。

There is no global recognition of Symbol, NEM is known better than symbol in some cases. So NEM brand should be changed to the symbolic brand position of XYM and XEM. I want your announcements globally that Symbol is the main role.


目前，許多交易所已經編寫了 NEM，而不是應該編寫為 NIS1 的內容。上面沒有Symbol的時候沒有什麼特別的問題，但現在我認為這是識別錯誤的原因之一。但是，我知道要糾正所有這些問題並不容易。問題是NEM中有兩條鏈（NIS1和symbol），很多人誤以為NEM=NIS1。為了以一種可以實現的方式解決這些問題，在NEM的框架外顯示Symbol是有效的。讓它看起來像 2 個項目中有 1 個鏈而不是 1 個項目中有 2 個鏈會更簡單，例如“NEM 中的 NIS1，Symbol中的Symbol（臨時）”而不是“NEM 中的 2 個鏈”。作為一個具體的方法，1）創建和運營一個符號信息傳輸（Twitter等）的僅限符號的帳戶2）不要使用NEM這個詞進行符號信息傳輸（hashtag等）等。我們認為相互信息和認知可以通過分別操作符號來正確傳達。

Currently many exchanges are using NEM when they should use NIS1. When there was no Symbol, not a problem, but now we believe that this is one of the reasons for the misunderstanding. However I know that it is not easy to correct all of this. The problem is that there are two chains in the NEM (NIS1 and Symbol) and lots of people mistakenly think that NEM = NIS1. To solve this point in a feasible way, I think it would be good to take Symbol out from the NEM. Instead of "2 chains in NEM", rather say simply "NIS1 in NEM, Symbol in Symbol (temporary)", represent 1 chain in each of the 2 projects, instead of 2 chains in 1 project. There are specific ways to.. E.G. 1)Create and operate a symbol focused account (e.g. Twitter) for disseminating symbol information. 2)Refrain from using the word NEM in any of Symbol's announcement (e.g. hashtag) and so on. I believe that it is important to keep the Symbol separate from the NEM, and each information will be conveyed properly.


進一步重命名Symbol只會造成混亂和摩擦。・ Symbol 和 NIS1 是同一個 NEM ・ Symbol 是第二代 NEM，性能很高。 ・ NIS1 是第一代 NEM。你所要做的就是給出一個解釋，把所有這些信息都推出去。再強調一點，Symbol 是主鏈。我厭倦了時尚和神秘的元素。

Further naming change of Symbol will only bring confusion and conflicting ・Symbol and NIS1 are same, both from NEM ・Symbol is the second generation of NEM, up-warded and more powerful ・NIS1 is the first generation of NEM That's all. The only thing that officials should do is to give a full explanation with this information. Should emphasise more the fact that Symbol is the main chain. I'm fed up with the fashionable and mysterious elements.

Symbol在開發上具有很高的自由度，可以用於任何東西，但它與其他貨幣的區別是模糊的。 我希望在各個領域看到更多用例，首先，從最有用的用例開始（從開發人員和企業的角度來看，不可見引入它的優點將是一個原因，儘管集成取決於公司的決定） )

Symbol has a high degree of freedom in development and can be used for anything, but it is obscure what's a difference from other currencies. I would like to see more use cases in various fields, firstly, starting with the most useful use cases (this, from developers and enterprise view not visible the merits of introducing it would be a reason, that integrations are up to the companies decisions though)

我覺得NEN，Symbol沒有被認可。更多地向交易所和公司推廣​​。現在是停止NGL內鬥的時候了。

I feel that NEN, Symbol are not being recognised. Promote more to exchanges and companies. And it's high time to stop infighting in NGL.

我不明白為什麼我要放棄 NEM 品牌。即使有黑客攻擊，NEM / XEM 也沒有問題。NEM 品牌有著悠久的歷史，所以你不應該因為一個錯誤就放棄它。品牌重塑後，我們必須從頭開始建立信任。目前，我認為 XYM 沒有這樣的空閒時間。像 Uniswap V3 一樣簡單地使用 NEM v2 / XYM 不是可以嗎？我想那個人會收到的。不必要的複雜會使新進入者感到困惑。首先，它比品牌重塑更受歡迎。與其像這樣摩擦內環，不如在NFT、DeFi等其他鏈落後的領域加強技術和客戶。你重新組織多少次，你犯了多少次同樣的錯誤？即使是基本的性能，比如 6000 的符號 Tx/s，也並不為大眾所熟知，即使你堅持這個名字，也不會改變。請在傳播 Symbol 和改善基礎設施後重塑品牌。多邊形 (MATIC) 就是一個很好的例子。Polygon 鞏固了 NFT 和 ETH 橋樑，並在穩定後更名。

I don't understand why I want to abandon the NEM brand. Even though there was a hack, it wasn't NEM/XEM's fault, the NEM brand has a history and shouldn't be let go by just one mistake. Once the rebranding is done, we have to start building trust again from zero. We don't think XYM has the time to do that at the moment. Why don't you simply say NEMv2/XYM like Uniswap V3? I think it would be more acceptable with everyone. Making things unnecessarily complicated will confuse newcomers. The first thing to do is to spread Symbol before rebranding. Instead of internal wrangling, should work on the technology and customers in areas where talking behind other chains, such as NFT and DeFi. How many times do we have to re-organise and make the similar mistakes over and over again, even the basic performance of a symbol, such as Tx/s of 6000, is not properly known to the public? Before thinking about rebranding, please promote Symbol and develop its infrastructure. Polygon (MATIC) is a good example which rebranded itself after consolidating and stabilising NFT and ETH Bridge.


如果 NEM (NIS1) 是 Symbol 的子鏈，那麼 Symbol 應該以 NEM 命名，NIS1 應該以不同的方式命名。我認為這個名字最容易理解，因為與日本相比，它在海外的知名度和理解度太低了。請清楚告知連接主鏈Symbol的許多子鏈的關係。如果您有未來的路線圖，請披露。

If NEM (NIS1) is a sub-chain of Symbol one day and it's planned, Symbol should be named after NEM and NIS1 should be named differently. I think that the clear naming is the best way to make it easier to understand, because the awareness and understanding abroad is too poor when compared with Japan. I would like to know about sub-chains connected to the main chain symbol more clearly. If there is any roadmap, please disclose it.

NEM和Symbol不兼容，毫無疑問，社區是沒有前提的劃分的，沒有必要強行連接它們。如果你真的想堅持NEM，你應該把剛剛誕生的Symbol命名為NEM2之類的。如果你真的想給它打上烙印，請把它命名為 NEM2 或類似的名字。即使我還沒有準備 NIS1 文檔，堅持使用 NEM 是荒謬的。

NEM and Symbol are incompatible and the community is definitely divided.There's no need to force two merges. If you really want to stick to NEM, you should change the name of the fledgling Symbol to NEM2 or something like that, but you don't want to change it. You say it's 'too late'. If you're serious about branding, make it NEM2 or something like that.　You can still start over. I mean, you haven't maintained the even documentation for NIS1, but it's ridiculous that you're forcing yourself to stick with NEM.


這個調查本身是由不太了解 NEM 的人創建的嗎？

Was this questionnaire itself created by someone with poor understanding of the NEM?


誰是此次品牌重塑提案和討論的協調員，擔任什麼職位？天然氣？核心脂肪？海盜？基於這次討論，您打算通過什麼樣的過程來決定品牌重塑的方向？是閉室會議嗎？是社區投票嗎？如果你要在社區投票，你如何決定候選人？（我已經厭倦了symbol 或seccoya 等糟糕的選擇。）要重塑品牌，我認為有必要重新創建網站，重新創建文檔等，並聯繫交易所。這些工作由誰來做，在什麼地方做位置？

Who is proposing this rebranding, and is in charge of organising the discussion? NGL? Core devs? Pirates? After this discussion, what process do you plan to use to decide on the direction of the rebranding? Is it a closed meeting? A community vote? And If you are going to have a community vote, how will you decide which candidate to choose? (I'm sick of choices that are both bad, like Symbol or Sekoya. choices we had) The rebranding process, re-designing of the website, re-documentation and managing with the exchanges will be required, but who will be in charge of this?

Kunoichi是女忍者的名字，我認為它的敏捷、技術、輕盈和美麗很符合形象。

Kunoichi is the name of a female ninja. I think that its quickness, technique, lightness and beauty fit the image.

在Symbol 推出之前，你有沒有很好的機會討論它？我認為。儘管NEM=NIS1的形像已經在世界範圍內生根發芽，但這種喧囂本身只是中心化的感覺，我認為這是對區塊鏈的一個負面影響。NEM經典（NIS1）和NEM（Symbol）更容易理解是可以理解的，但這是一個品牌問題嗎？

You did have enough time to discuss this before the Symbol launch. Even though the image of NEM = NIS1 has been established in the public mind, the whole mess itself feels centralised, which I think is a negative for a blockchain. It's understandable that something like NEM classic (NIS1) or NEM (Symbol) would be easier to understand, but is it a branding issue?

我要你堅決宣傳XYM。

More sincere XYM promotion that I want.

我們期待增加 NEM (XEM) 和 XYM 的價值。

I'm looking forward to seeing the value of NEM (XEM) and XYM increase.

我認為我們應該把更多的符號帶到前面並吸引人。大多數人不會熟悉 Symbol，即使他們熟悉，也感覺它們被視為比特現金和以太坊經典等。我敢肯定，有些人一開始並不了解 Symbol。必須清楚地表明，Symbol 作為主區塊鏈已經換代了，而 NIS1 已經轉向了子區塊鏈。

I think you should appeal Symbol more at the forefront of the brand. Most people don't know much about Symbol, and even if they know it, they probably take it kind of a subordinate to Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, etc. There are people who don't even know what Symbol is.

“NEM”而不是 XYM ，但你應該使用“NEM”而不是 XYM

You should have used "NEM" instead of XYM

無論聽起來多麼好，談論史詩般的未來，當前的圖表都說明了整個故事。對 XEM、XYM 和 NEM 項目感到失望。整個市場的預期較低。我不覺得在其他項目中看到的絕望。不逃避現實，兼顧發展與提升。即使你有一定的技術技能，我認為你現在的立場也不能吸引很多人。

No matter how much we talk about a grand future, the current chart says it all: disappointed with XEM, XYM and the NEM project. Markets have low expectations. But I don't feel the desperation that is often sawn in other projects. Please keep an eye on reality and balance development and promotion. Even if the technology is solid, I don't think you can attract many people with your current stance.

NIS1這個名字在符號推出之前就已經有很強的XEM/NEM形象了。我認為虛擬貨幣交易所的名稱也有影響。目前我覺得那個符號應該是主鏈，所以我覺得有必要統一XEM鏈的名稱和虛擬貨幣交易所的名稱。如果重生為符號的子鏈，我覺得是從NIS1改名的好機會。

The name NIS1 was strongly associated with XEM/NEM before the launch of the Symbol. I think that the name may also be influenced by the names of virtual currency exchanges and so on. If NIS1 is to be reborn as a sub-chain of Symbol, it would be a good opportunity to change the name from NIS1.

基本上，我們支持現有的，但如果你想改變一些東西，你可以製作 NIS1 標誌，並在銷售辦事處和交易所使用 NIS1 XEM Symbol而不是 NEM XEM。我認為可能是這樣。或者我認為，讓Symbol成為比NEM更高的品牌，把NEM、NIS1作為Symbol的子鏈之一，會是一隻螞蟻。

Basically, I'm in favour of keeping things the way they are, but if there were to make any changes, I think it would be better to make a new NIS1 logo, and if we called it NIS1/XEM instead of NEM/XEM on the exchanges. Alternatively, Symbol could be a higher brand than NEM, and NEM and NIS1 could be one of Symbol's sub-chains.

我知道併購買 XEM 的原因是因為我知道 Symbol (XYM)。XYM的收穫收入和出售時的資本收益對我來說是一個鉤子，讓我產生了興趣。我很期待 Symbol 未來的創新。我還沒有足夠的知識，但只要我在投資，我希望我能學習並為XYM和XEM的發展做出貢獻。

The reason I bought XEM is, I found out about Symbol (XYM) , knew the harvesting income and the capital gain from selling it hooked me and got me interested. I am looking forward to the innovations that Symbol will bring to the market. I am still learning, but as long as I am investing, I hope to learn more and contribute to the development of XYM and XEM.

Symbol不是 NIS1

Rather Symbol than NIS1

知名廠商都有過往的故事，背書多年，但Symbol卻沒有這樣的故事。此外，故事不是由主辦方創造的，但支持者通過產品聚集並自然發生的強烈。一個品牌不是用來炫耀的，而是用來背書的。

Famous brands have a story to tell and have been supported for many years, but Symbol has no such story yet. But, the story is not created by the organiser, by the product itself. A brand is not something to be flaunted, it is something to be supported.

使用鏈名稱 NEM Classic 和 NEM Symbol 是個好主意。最好讓附近的人一眼就知道 NIS1 是較老的鏈。

It is better to name NEM Classic and NEM Symbol. It would be better if cryptor outside of NEM can see at a glance that NIS1 is the older chain.

NEM=XEM的形象領先於大眾，Symbol作為主鏈的形象弱。乍一看真的很難理解，即使您快速瀏覽或收到解釋。我想很多人都覺得Symbol / xym不為人熟知，誤解無處不在，結果是NEM，而不是Symbol，在價格上領先。結果，我想如果我燒了xem，我就可以做到沒有這樣的誤解。我認為品牌化也很重要，但不管怎樣，（1）Symbol 是主鏈，（2）NEM 是子鏈，以及（3）雙方未來將如何使用。我認為重要的是繼續.我認為這很難。 NGL也將被拆除，因此非常感謝您的長期活動。我們支持工程師，讓他們以後可以全身心投入到開發中，以白人狀態，不以利潤為先！ !! !! !!我們期待Symbol被廣泛使用、交易飛揚、工程師得到獎勵的那一天。

There is a prevailing image of NEM as XEM. And Symbol as the main chain is weak. The lack of awareness of Symbol/xym has led to misunderstandings everywhere, and as a result, many people have felt the dilemma of NEM being ahead in price instead of Symbol. I think that if we had burned xem as a result, we could have done without these misunderstandings. I think branding is important, but anyway, now ①Symbol is a main chain ②NEM is a sub chain ③How will both will be used in the future I think it's important to communicate these clearly and to continue to do so. I know it's not an easy job, and I'm sorry to hear that NGL will be closed, so thank you for all your hard work over the years. I wish you all the best and hope that the engineers will be able to put all their efforts into development in the future. ！！！！

我想很多人在不知道 Symbol 和 NIS1 之間的區別的情況下購買 XEM 或 XYM。似乎“似乎有什麼新的驚人的鏈誕生了！好吧，讓我們購買這個 XEM 等等！”之類的事情實際上正在發生。您應該從 NIS1 中刪除名稱 NEM 或使其類似於 NEM Classic。

I suppose many people buy XEM or XYM without knowing the difference between Symbol and NIS1. "New amazing chain Symbol has launched! Okay, I'll buy XEM!" like this kind of lack of knowledge. NIS1 should be removed the name of NEM or change it to NEM Classic etc.

窮人的大逆轉開始了✨

The great reversal of the poor people begins✨

技術再好，不使用也沒有意義。

No matter how good the technology is, it is useless if it is not used.

xym 是Symbol，xem 是 NEM，就是這樣。從今以後不要退縮。我對Symbol有很高的期望，但是為了增加Symbol的價值而相對降低nem / xem的價值的品牌是錯誤的。取下nem是一個荒謬的故事。而不是這樣，我認為應該加快Symbol的傳播，並儘早實現與xem的合作。

xym is Symbol, xem is NEM, that's it. Please don't degenerate now. I am counting on Symbol, but diminishing the relative value of nem/xem in order to increase the value of symbol, is not a good way of branding scheme. I think you should hurry up and promote the usage of Symbol and make it work with xem as soon as possible.


(NEM) NEM (NIS1) / XEM 符號 / XYM 我們不應該盡最大努力讓大家知道嗎？我覺得除了日本以外的國家都沒有做出足夠的努力來讓他們知道。我認為更改名稱不是一件簡單的事情。在 Catapult 品牌提案的時候，品牌名稱 Symbol 從一開始就決定了，社區別無選擇，只能批准或不批准。雖然Symbol 是通過投票選出的，但日本社區花了很長時間才接受這個品牌名稱。

(NEM) NEM(NIS1) / XEM Symbol / XYM Why don't you make a steady effort to make this known? I feel that countries other than Japan are not making enough effort to have this known. Just changing the name will not solve the problem. When the Catapult branding proposals At the time, the brand name Symbol had been chosen from the outset and the community had no choice but to approve it or not. After a vote, Symbol was chosen. It took a lot of time for the Japanese community to accept this brand name.

作為投資者，我對這一系列事件感到非常失望。從出生到現在已經有四個月左右了，所以市場可能會原諒我，但對於Symbol或NEM來說，把這個案子拖得太久是不好的。它出生時沒有名字或品牌嗎？你現在是在向社會徵求意見嗎？是出生前就應該整理的內容，幼稚的管理讓我心疼。即使技術再好，根據運營情況，未來也可能充滿不確定性，不鼓勵投資。如果您更改了名稱，請盡快採取適當的措施。我查看了調查問卷的結果，但根據受訪者是 XEM 還是 XYM，觀點差異很大。徵求意見是好的，但請理解受訪者有不同的觀點，收集數據。很難讓所有受訪者都滿意，所以要適當選擇和集中。當您聽到 NEM 時，您可能對 XEM 和 XYM 都有深入的了解。通常，您可能會將其與 NEM = XEM 相關聯。NIS1 仍然普遍未知。你認識多少普通投資者？把這一切都推過去並傳播這個名字是否現實？如果太複雜，就會出現很多人不能正確理解的問題。如果過於復雜，會阻礙一定數量的投資者進行投資。這個問題對Symbol 的企業使用有相當大的影響。名稱和概念的追求必須在某處平衡。我擔心如果強調名稱或概念的正確性，符號可能會變得複雜。分別支持NEM/XEM和Symbol/XYM是現實的，如果信息從不同的賬戶發送，可能會減少混亂。從 NEM 賬戶發送符號信息一直有一種強烈的不適感。我是來獲取Symbol信息的，但是我必須把XEM信息看成一個集合。符號 / XYM 已經在多個交易所 它列在。以後改名的時候，光是宣傳改名是不夠的，除非你向繼續貼舊信息的媒體和交易所仔細說明，要求更正，在改名前我希望你決定並實施變更後的措施，以免信息造成進一步的誤解、混淆和復雜性。

As an investor, I am very disappointed with this whole thing. It's only 4 months since we were born, so the market may just about forgive it, but it's not good for Symbol or NEM to let this go on too long. You have launched without final decision with names and branding? And now you want to solicit it from the community? This is the sort of thing that should have been sorted out before the launch and it is sad to see how poorly it has been managed. Even if the technology is good, the management will make us feel insecure about the future and discourage us from investing. If you are going to change the name, please do it quickly and appropriately. The results of the survey responses have a big difference in perspective between respondents who are on XEM or XYM side. It is good to solicit opinions, but please be aware of the different perspectives of the respondents and collect data accordingly. It is difficult to satisfy all respondents, so please be selective and focused appropriately. When people hear the word NEM, probably only people who know well about NEM associate it with both XEM and XYM if you understand it deeply. In general, you probably associate NEM with XEM. NIS1 is still unknown to the general public. How many ordinary investors know about it? Is it realistic to push it out there now and promote the name? If it is too complex, there will always be a problem of not being understood properly by many people and it can discourage some investors from investing at a constant rate. This problem also affects the enterprise adoption of Symbol too. The pursuit of names and concepts has to be balanced at some point. I am afraid that if we focus on the correctness of names and concepts, the notation will become more complex. Having separate NEM/XEM and Symbol/XYM would be a more realistic way to be, and preparing two accounts to tweet each information is less confusing to disseminate information. For a long time now, I have been very uncomfortable with the fact that Symbol information is sent from the NEM account. I look there to get information about Symbol, but I have to look at the XEM information as well. Symbol/XYM is already listed on several exchanges. If you decide to change the name in the future, it is not enough to simply announce that you have changed the name, but unless you carefully explain the change to the media and exchanges that continue to publish outdated information and ask them to correct it constantly, the information before the change will cause further misunderstanding, confusion and complexity more.



NIS1這個名字在符號推出之前就已經有很強的XEM/NEM形象了。我認為虛擬貨幣交易所的名稱也有影響。目前我覺得那個符號應該是主鏈，所以我覺得有必要統一XEM鏈的名稱和虛擬貨幣交易所的名稱。如果重生為符號的子鏈，我覺得是從NIS1改名的好機會。

The name NIS1 was strongly associated with XEM/NEM before the launch of symbol. I think that the name may also be influenced by the ticker symbol of crypto currency exchanges. I feel that the name of the XEM chain and the name of crypto currency exchange need to be unified, as we believe that symbol should be the main chain at present. If NIS1 is going to be reborn as a sub-chain of Symbol, I think it is a good opportunity to change the name from NIS1.

Symbol是太普通的詞。符號在會議和會議上不是一個快照，我覺得這個名字並沒有傳達它的目的或目的。

Symbol is too generic nouns. In a conference or meeting, when talking about Symbol doesn't sound right, and we feel that the name doesn't convey the purpose or use.

激活 NEMHUB。增加任務，在任務中了解廣泛收集的視頻等

Use NEMHUB task more actively. Increase the number of tasks & spread the videos etc. gathered by the tasks to promote Symbol.

與其重建品牌，我認為最好以通俗易懂的方式公開介紹結果，並在Symbol誕生後的階段專注於解釋和信息共享。就像採用羅氏一樣，我們將傳達引入公司的優點，並增加實際使用該鏈的公司數量。請使用它。我們將在可以披露的範圍內披露案例研究和影響。尤其是對貿易相關公司的猛烈攻擊。兼容性太好了。給“成人”一個商業型利潤和銷售增長工具的形象。NFT 領域的競爭者眾多，似乎即使無人看管它們也會增長。斥資1億打造內部分銷系統的時代已經結束。一個聰明的公司使用虛擬貨幣機制來構建一個符號為 x nem 的理性系統。認為“虛擬貨幣=冒煙”的“大人”難道不能打上烙印嗎？如果僅限於日本，則可以通過使用供應鏈改革等補貼的公司可以引入的機制來促進引入。我認為如果發現國家利益會增加，國家會合作。我對業餘意見感到抱歉。

Rather than rebuilding the brand, I think that the phase from now on, after the Symbol has been launched, should focus on publishing, explaining and sharing the results of the introduction in a clear way. Announce the benefits of corporate adoption, such as the adoption of Roche, and increase the number of companies that use the chain actually. It's all about enterprises using it. Show examples of how they have used it and how it works. We are particularly keen on companies in the trade sector. Publishing examples of past installations and their effects as far as you can. We are particularly interested in companies in the trade sector. I think it is the best match. The image of a commercial tool for increasing sales and profits, aimed at "business bases". There is a lot of competition in the NFT field and it will grow even if it is left alone. "The era of investing hundreds of millions in building their own distribution system is over. Smart companies are using the blockchain to build a rational system with symbol×nem." If the branding is like that, "business bases" who think that "crypto currency = fishy" may turn their attention to it. It is possible to promote the introduction of crypto currency in Japan by using a system that allows companies to use subsidies for supply chain rebuilding. I think the government would be more supportive if they knew that it would benefit the country. I apologise for my amateurish opinion.


目前狀況不好，請活躍起來

Stop saying only "beautiful-sounding phrases", just make it exciting.

您應該考慮投資者將如何看待重建您剛剛創建的Symbol的想法。

perceive the idea of rebuilding the Symbol you have just created.


我認為需要 NEM（NIS1）進化的鍊是 Symbol 的強烈信息和成就。我認為需要傳達一個強烈的信息，即 Symbol 是 NEM (NIS1) 演化而來的鏈。還有它的過往記錄。

strong message that Symbol is the chain NEM (NIS1) evolved from. And also its track record as well.

你在胡鬧什麼？品牌每次... 地球上的震央在哪裡？首先，這種說法僅僅是因為Symbol的價格低於 xem 並且 xym 持有者開始變得不耐煩了，不是嗎？如果您將其命名為NEM，您認為價格會上漲嗎？是否期望Symbol流向 xem？不是這樣嗎？首先，XEM/NEM是次要貨幣，現在買xym的人和我們一樣。首先，就算有好的出資者出來也沒有地方買。如果Symbol開始在各大交易所上市，得到認可，處理它的公司數量增加並被評估，價格自然應該超過xem。先有雞蛋還是先有雞，但是如果你想提高價格，為什麼不先專注於在交易所上架xym/symbol呢？?? ?? 我不認為單單上市就漲，但作為前提，除非有地方買，否則不談。

What are you always messing about with? How many times talking about branding.... Where is the epicenter of all this confusion? Isn't the whole debate just about the fact that XYM price is lower than XEM, XYM holders are getting impatient? Do you think the price will moon if you name the NEM on it? Do you think people expect that XYM will be replaced by XEM? How can that be? XEM/NEM is also a minor currency and the only people who buy XYM currently are just curious people like us. Even if there is a good fundamental, there is no place to buy it. When Symbol starts to be listed on major exchanges, and will be recognized and valued by more and more enterprises, the price will naturally surpass XEM. It's kind of a question of eggs first or chickens first, but if you want to increase the price, why not focus on listing XYM/Symbol on exchanges first? I don't think it will raise just by listing it, but the premise is that if there's no place to buy, there's nothing to talk about.



包括核心開發人員，記住在小型組織中的焦慮

I'm worried about small organisation, including the core developers.

我們需要認真的討論和總結。

We need a serious discussion and conclusion.

我支持，但我認為普通人使用它們而不知道它們是理想的。例如，我希望它成為其他虛擬貨幣無法做到的社交系統，例如當購買或匯款時日元變成XYM，然後返回日元。
我是Symbol的粉絲，但我認為最理想的情況是讓普通大眾不用考慮Symbol就可以使用它。比如你買東西或轉賬時，你的日元會在不知不覺中被XYM取代我希望 Symbol 將成為其他虛擬貨幣無法做到的社會系統。

I'm a Symbol fan, but I think the ideal situation would be for the general public to use it without thinking of the Symbol. For example, when you buy something or transfer money, your Yen will be replaced by XYM before you know it, and it will be returned to Yen. I hope that Symbol will be a system for society that other virtual currencies cannot do.

##### Total respondents: 21



01.- When you hear "NEM" do you first think...

13	| XEM
2	| XYM
6   | XEM & XYM


Before the advent of Symbol, the ecosystem was perceived as: NEM or NIS1 as a blockchain and the XEM ticker as a utility token. Most Russian-speaking users understand that there is one NEM ecosystem, but with two blockchains, each with its own ticker, for NEM it is XEM, and for Symbol it is XYM.


----
02.- When you hear "Symbol" do you first think...

1	| XEM
16  | XYM
4	| XEM & XYM

Users associate Symbol with their XYM utility token rather than with NEM - XEM. New users are more interested in Symbol and XYM, for receiving coins in connection with the snapshot.

----
03.- Should "NEM" be rebranded?

4	| Yes
17	| No

Most of the Russian-speaking user thinks that we shouldn't change the NEM brand.

----
05.- Should "Symbol" be rebranded?

3	| Yes
17	| No


85% of the surveyed users believe that the Symbol brand should not be changed, but should be preserved. This means that Symbol is easier to associate with the XYM ticker.

----
06.- Which would you prefer to see more of?

18	| Symbol
3	| NEM

Almost all 18 out of 21 want to know more about Symbol, as Symbol is the second iteration of the NEM blockchain (next phase of the ecosystem).

----
07.- Which brand should be the Flagship brand? (Priority focus)

16	| Symbol

If we are talking about what brand should be as a flagship, then Symbol is in the spotlight.
